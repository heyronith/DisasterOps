This booklet is a companion document to the NIMS ICS Field Operations Guide (FOG), FEMA 502-1, which\nprovides general guidance to emergency responders on implementing ICS. This booklet is meant to complement existing\nincident management programs and does not replace relevant emergency operations plans, laws, and ordinances. These\nforms are designed for use within the Incident Command System, and are not targeted for use in Area Command or in\nmultiagency coordination systems.\nThese forms are intended for use as tools for the creation of Incident Action Plans (IAPs), for other incident management\nactivities, and for support and documentation of ICS activities. Personnel using the forms should have a basic\nunderstanding of NIMS, including ICS, through training and/or experience to ensure they can effectively use and\nunderstand these forms. These ICS Forms represent an all-hazards approach and update to previously used ICS Forms.\nWhile the layout and specific blocks may have been updated, the functionality of the forms remains the same. It is\nrecommended that all users familiarize themselves with the updated forms and instructions.\nA general description of each ICS Form’s purpose, suggested preparation, and distribution are included immediately after\nthe form, including block-by-block completion instructions to ensure maximum clarity on specifics, or for those personnel\nwho may be unfamiliar with the forms.\nThe ICS organizational charts contained in these forms are examples of how an ICS organization is typically developed\nfor incident response. However, the flexibility and scalability of ICS allow modifications, as needed, based on experience\nand particular incident requirements.\nThese forms are designed to include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address. The use of these\nstandardized ICS Forms is encouraged to promote consistency in the management and documentation of incidents in the\nspirit of NIMS, and to facilitate effective use of mutual aid. In many cases, additional pages can be added to the existing\nICS Forms when needed, and several forms are set up with this specific provision. The section after the ICS Forms List\nprovides details on adding appendixes or fields to the forms for jurisdiction- or discipline-specific needs.\nIt may be appropriate to compile and maintain other NIMS-related forms with these ICS Forms, such as resource\nmanagement and/or ordering forms that are used to support incidents. Examples of these include the following\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) forms: REQ-A (Interstate Mutual Aid Request), Reimbursement\nForm R-1 (Interstate Reimbursement Form), and Reimbursement Form R-2 (Intrastate Reimbursement Form).\n\n\nICS FORMS LIST\nThis table lists all of the ICS Forms included in this publication.\nNotes:\n• In the following table, the ICS Forms identified with an asterisk (*) are typically included in an IAP.\n• Forms identified with two asterisks (**) are additional forms that could be used in the IAP.\n• The other ICS Forms are used in the ICS process for incident management activities, but are not typically included in\nthe IAP.\n• The date and time entered in the form blocks should be determined by the Incident Command or Unified Command.\nLocal time is typically used.\nICS Form #: Form Title: Typically Prepared by:\nICS 201 Incident Briefing Initial Incident Commander\n*ICS 202 Incident Objectives Planning Section Chief\n*ICS 203 Organization Assignment List Resources Unit Leader\n*ICS 204 Assignment List Resources Unit Leader and Operations Section\nChief\n*ICS 205 Incident Radio Communications Plan Communications Unit Leader\n**ICS 205A Communications List Communications Unit Leader\n*ICS 206 Medical Plan Medical Unit Leader (reviewed by Safety Officer)\nICS 207 Incident Organization Chart Resources Unit Leader\n(wall-mount size, optional 8½″ x 14″)\n**ICS 208 Safety Message/Plan Safety Officer\nICS 209 Incident Status Summary Situation Unit Leader\nICS 210 Resource Status Change Communications Unit Leader\nICS 211 Incident Check-In List Resources Unit/Check-In Recorder\n(optional 8½″ x 14″ and 11″ x 17″)\nICS 213 General Message (3-part form) Any Message Originator\nICS 214 Activity Log (optional 2-sided form) All Sections and Units\nICS 215 Operational Planning Worksheet Operations Section Chief\n(optional 8½″ x 14″ and 11″ x 17″)\nICS 215A Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis Safety Officer\nICS 218 Support Vehicle/Equipment Inventory Ground Support Unit\n(optional 8½″ x 14″ and 11″ x 17″)\nICS 219-1 to ICS Resource Status Card (T-Card) Resources Unit\n219-8, ICS 219-10 (may be printed on cardstock)\n(Cards)\nICS 220 Air Operations Summary Worksheet Operations Section Chief or Air Branch Director\nICS 221 Demobilization Check-Out Demobilization Unit Leader\nICS 225 Incident Personnel Performance Supervisor at the incident\nRating\n\n\nICS FORM ADAPTION, EXTENSION, AND APPENDIXES\nThe ICS Forms in this booklet are designed to serve all-hazards, cross-discipline needs for incident management across\nthe Nation. These forms include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address, and create a foundation\nwithin ICS for complex incident management activities. However, the flexibility and scalability of NIMS should allow for\nneeds outside this foundation, so the following are possible mechanisms to add to, extend, or adapt ICS Forms when\nneeded.\nBecause the goal of NIMS is to have a consistent nationwide approach to incident management, jurisdictions and\ndisciplines are encouraged to use the ICS Forms as they are presented here – unless these forms do not meet an\norganization’s particular incident management needs for some unique reason. If changes are needed, the focus on\nessential information elements should remain, and as such the spirit and intent of particular fields or “information\nelements” on the ICS Forms should remain intact to maintain consistency if the forms are altered. Modifications should be\nclearly indicated as deviations from or additions to the ICS Forms. The following approaches may be used to meet any\nunique needs.\nICS Form Adaptation\nWhen agencies and organizations require specialized forms or information for particular kinds of incidents, events, or\ndisciplines, it may be beneficial to utilize the essential data elements from a particular ICS Form to create a more localized\nor field-specific form. When this occurs, organizations are encouraged to use the relevant essential data elements and\nICS Form number, but to clarify that the altered form is a specific organizational adaptation of the form. For example, an\naltered form should clearly indicate in the title that it has been changed to meet a specific need, such as “ICS 215A,\nHazard Risk Analysis Worksheet, Adapted for Story County Hazmat Program.”\nExtending ICS Form Fields\nParticular fields on an ICS Form may need to include further breakouts or additional related elements. If such additions\nare needed, the form itself should be clearly labeled as an adapted form (see above), and the additional sub-field\nnumbers should be clearly labeled as unique to the adapted form. Letters or other indicators may be used to label the\nnew sub-fields (if the block does not already include sub-fields).\nExamples of possible field additions are shown below for the ICS 209:\n• Block 2: Incident Number.\n• Block 2A (adapted): Full agency accounting cost charge number for primary authority having jurisdiction.\n• Block 29: Primary Materials or Hazards Involved (hazardous chemicals, fuel types, infectious agents, radiation, etc.).\n• Block 29A (adapted): Indicate specific wildland fire fuel model number.\nCreating ICS Form Appendixes\nCertain ICS Forms may require appendixes to include additional information elements needed by a particular jurisdiction\nor discipline. When an appendix is needed for a given form, it is expected that the jurisdiction or discipline will determine\nstandardized fields for such an appendix and make the form available as needed.\nAny ICS Form appendixes should be clearly labeled with the form name and an indicator that it is a discipline- or\njurisdiction-specific appendix. Appendix field numbering should begin following the last identified block in the\ncorresponding ICS Form.\n\n\nINCIDENT BRIEFING (ICS 201)\n1.Incident Name: 2.Incident Number: 3.Date/Time Initiated:\nDate: Time:\n4.Map/Sketch (include sketch, showing the total area of operations, the incident site/area, impacted and threatened\nareas, overflight results, trajectories, impacted shorelines, or other graphics depicting situational status and resource\nassignment):\n5.Situation Summary and Health and Safety Briefing (for briefings or transfer of command): Recognize potential\nincident Health and Safety Hazards and develop necessary measures (remove hazard, provide personal protective\nequipment, warn people of the hazard) to protect responders from those hazards.\n6.Prepared by: Name: Position/Title: Signature:\nICS 201, Page 1 Date/Time:\n\n\nINCIDENT BRIEFING (ICS 201)\n1.

The Organization Assignment List (ICS 203) provides ICS personnel with information on the units that are\ncurrently activated and the names of personnel staffing each position/unit. It is used to complete the Incident\nOrganization Chart (ICS 207) which is posted on the Incident Command Post display. An actual organization will be\nincident or event-specific. Not all positions need to be filled. Some blocks may contain more than one name. The size\nof the organization is dependent on the magnitude of the incident, and can be expanded or contracted as necessary.\nPreparation. The Resources Unit prepares and maintains this list under the direction of the Planning Section Chief.\nComplete only the blocks for the positions that are being used for the incident. If a trainee is assigned to a position,\nindicate this with a “T” in parentheses behind the name (e.g., “A. Smith (T)”).\nDistribution.

The ICS 209 is used for reporting information on significant incidents. It is not intended for every incident, as\nmost incidents are of short duration and do not require scarce resources, significant mutual aid, or additional support and\nattention. The ICS 209 contains basic information elements needed to support decisionmaking at all levels above the\nincident to support the incident. Decisionmakers may include the agency having jurisdiction, but also all multiagency\ncoordination system (MACS) elements and parties, such as cooperating and assisting agencies/organizations, dispatch\ncenters, emergency operations centers, administrators, elected officials, and local, tribal, county, State, and Federal\nagencies. Once ICS 209 information has been submitted from the incident, decisionmakers and others at all incident\nsupport and coordination points may transmit and share the information (based on its sensitivity and appropriateness) for\naccess and use at local, regional, State, and national levels as it is needed to facilitate support.\nAccurate and timely completion of the ICS 209 is necessary to identify appropriate resource needs, determine allocation\nof limited resources when multiple incidents occur, and secure additional capability when there are limited resources due\nto constraints of time, distance, or other factors. The information included on the ICS 209 influences the priority of the\nincident, and thus its share of available resources and incident support.\nThe ICS 209 is designed to provide a “snapshot in time” to effectively move incident decision support information where it\nis needed. It should contain the most accurate and up-to-date information available at the time it is prepared. However,\nreaders of the ICS 209 may have access to more up-to-date or real-time information in reference to certain information\nelements on the ICS 209. Coordination among communications and information management elements within ICS and\namong MACS should delineate authoritative sources for more up-to-date and/or real-time information when ICS 209\ninformation becomes outdated in a quickly evolving incident.\nReporting Requirements. The ICS 209 is intended to be used when an incident reaches a certain threshold where it\nbecomes significant enough to merit special attention, require additional resource support needs, or cause media\nattention, increased public safety threat, etc. Agencies or organizations may set reporting requirements and, therefore,\nICS 209s should be completed according to each jurisdiction or discipline’s policies, mobilization guide, or preparedness\nplans. It is recommended that consistent ICS 209 reporting parameters be adopted and used by jurisdictions or\ndisciplines for consistency over time, documentation, efficiency, trend monitoring, incident tracking, etc.\nFor example, an agency or MAC (Multiagency Coordination) Group may require the submission of an initial ICS 209 when\na new incident has reached a certain predesignated level of significance, such as when a given number of resources are\ncommitted to the incident, when a new incident is not completed within a certain timeframe, or when impacts/threats to life\nand safety reach a given level.\nTypically, ICS 209 forms are completed either once daily or for each operational period – in addition to the initial\nsubmission. Jurisdictional or organizational guidance may indicate frequency of ICS 209 submission for particular\ndefinitions of incidents or for all incidents. This specific guidance may help determine submission timelines when\noperational periods are extremely short (e.g., 2 hours) and it is not necessary to submit new ICS 209 forms for all\noperational periods.\nAny plans or guidelines should also indicate parameters for when it is appropriate to stop submitting ICS 209s for an\nincident, based upon incident activity and support levels.\nPreparation. When an Incident Management Organization (such as an Incident Management Team) is in place, the\nSituation Unit Leader or Planning Section Chief prepares the ICS 209 at the incident. On other incidents, the ICS 209\nmay be completed by a dispatcher in the local communications center, or by another staff person or manager. This form\nshould be completed at the incident or at the closest level to the incident.\nThe ICS 209 should be completed with the best possible, currently available, and verifiable information at the time it is\ncompleted and signed.\nThis form is designed to serve incidents impacting specific geographic areas that can easily be defined. It also has the\nflexibility for use on ubiquitous events, or those events that cover extremely large areas and that may involve many\njurisdictions and ICS organizations. For these incidents, it will be useful to clarify on the form exactly which portion of the\nlarger incident the ICS 209 is meant to address. For example, a particular ICS 209 submitted during a statewide outbreak\nof mumps may be relevant only to mumps-related activities in Story County, Iowa. This can be indicated in both the\nincident name, Block 1, and in the Incident Location Information section in Blocks 16–26.\n\n\nWhile most of the “Incident Location Information” in Blocks 16–26 is optional, the more information that can be submitted,\nthe better. Submission of multiple location indicators increases accuracy, improves interoperability, and increases\ninformation sharing between disparate systems. Preparers should be certain to follow accepted protocols or standards\nwhen entering location information, and clearly label all location information. As with other ICS 209 data, geospatial\ninformation may be widely shared and utilized, so accuracy is essential.\nIf electronic data is submitted with the ICS 209, do not attach or send extremely large data files. Incident geospatial data\nthat is distributed with the ICS 209 should be in simple incident geospatial basics, such as the incident perimeter, point of\norigin, etc. Data file sizes should be small enough to be easily transmitted through dial-up connections or other limited\ncommunications capabilities when ICS 209 information is transmitted electronically. Any attached data should be clearly\nlabeled as to format content and collection time, and should follow existing naming conventions and standards.\nDistribution. ICS 209 information is meant to be completed at the level as close to the incident as possible, preferably at\nthe incident. Once the ICS 209 has been submitted outside the incident to a dispatch center or MACS element, it may\nsubsequently be transmitted to various incident supports and coordination entities based on the support needs and the\ndecisions made within the MACS in which the incident occurs.\nCoordination with public information system elements and investigative/intelligence information organizations at the\nincident and within MACS is essential to protect information security and to ensure optimal information sharing and\ncoordination. There may be times in which particular ICS 209s contain sensitive information that should not be released\nto the public (such as information regarding active investigations, fatalities, etc.). When this occurs, the ICS 209 (or\nrelevant sections of it) should be labeled appropriately, and care should be taken in distributing the information within\nMACS.\nAll completed and signed original ICS 209 forms MUST be given to the incident’s Documentation Unit and/or maintained\nas part of the official incident record.\nNotes:\n• To promote flexibility, only a limited number of ICS 209 blocks are typically required, and most of those are required\nonly when applicable.\n• Most fields are optional, to allow responders to use the form as best fits their needs and protocols for information\ncollection.\n• For the purposes of the ICS 209, responders are those personnel who are assigned to an incident or who are a part of\nthe response community as defined by NIMS. This may include critical infrastructure owners and operators,\nnongovernmental and nonprofit organizational personnel, and contract employees (such as caterers), depending on\nlocal/jurisdictional/discipline practices.\n• For additional flexibility only pages 1–3 are numbered, for two reasons:\nPossible submission of additional pages for the Remarks Section (Block 47), and\no\nPossible submission of additional copies of the fourth/last page (the “Incident Resource Commitment Summary”) to\no\nprovide a more detailed resource summary.\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n*1 Incident Name REQUIRED BLOCK.\n• Enter the full name assigned to the incident.\n• Check spelling of the full incident name.\n• For an incident that is a Complex, use the word “Complex” at the end of\nthe incident name.\n• If the name changes, explain comments in Remarks, Block 47.\n• Do not use the same incident name for different incidents in the same\ncalendar year.\n\n\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n2 Incident Number • Enter the appropriate number based on current guidance.

Check-in consists\nof reporting specific information, which is recorded on the Check-In List (ICS 211). The ICS 211 serves several purposes,\nas it: (1) records arrival times at the incident of all overhead personnel and equipment, (2) records the initial location of\npersonnel and equipment to facilitate subsequent assignments, and (3) supports demobilization by recording the home\nbase, method of travel, etc., for resources checked in.\nPreparation. The ICS 211 is initiated at a number of incident locations including: Staging Areas, Base, and Incident\nCommand Post (ICP). Preparation may be completed by: (1) overhead at these locations, who record the information\nand give it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (2) the Incident Communications Center Manager located in the\nCommunications Center, who records the information and gives it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (3) a\nrecorder from the Resources Unit during check-in to the ICP. As an option, the ICS 211 can be printed on colored paper\nto match the designated Resource Status Card (ICS 219) colors. The purpose of this is to aid the process of completing a\nlarge volume of ICS 219s. The ICS 219 colors are:\n• 219-1: Header Card – Gray (used only as label cards for T-Card racks)\n• 219-2: Crew/Team Card – Green\n• 219-3: Engine Card – Rose\n• 219-4: Helicopter Card – Blue\n• 219-5: Personnel Card – White\n• 219-6: Fixed-Wing Card – Orange\n• 219-7: Equipment Card – Yellow\n• 219-8: Miscellaneous Equipment/Task Force Card – Tan\n• 219-10: Generic Card – Light Purple\nDistribution. ICS 211s, which are completed by personnel at the various check-in locations, are provided to the\nResources Unit, Demobilization Unit, and Finance/Administration Section.

      "text": "INTRODUCTION TO ICS FORMS\nThe National Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS) Forms Booklet, FEMA 502-2, is\ndesigned to assist emergency response personnel in the use of ICS and corresponding documentation during incident\noperations. This booklet is a companion document to the NIMS ICS Field Operations Guide (FOG), FEMA 502-1, which\nprovides general guidance to emergency responders on implementing ICS. This booklet is meant to complement existing\nincident management programs and does not replace relevant emergency operations plans, laws, and ordinances. These\nforms are designed for use within the Incident Command System, and are not targeted for use in Area Command or in\nmultiagency coordination systems.\nThese forms are intended for use as tools for the creation of Incident Action Plans (IAPs), for other incident management\nactivities, and for support and documentation of ICS activities. Personnel using the forms should have a basic\nunderstanding of NIMS, including ICS, through training and/or experience to ensure they can effectively use and\nunderstand these forms. These ICS Forms represent an all-hazards approach and update to previously used ICS Forms.\nWhile the layout and specific blocks may have been updated, the functionality of the forms remains the same. It is\nrecommended that all users familiarize themselves with the updated forms and instructions.\nA general description of each ICS Form’s purpose, suggested preparation, and distribution are included immediately after\nthe form, including block-by-block completion instructions to ensure maximum clarity on specifics, or for those personnel\nwho may be unfamiliar with the forms.\nThe ICS organizational charts contained in these forms are examples of how an ICS organization is typically developed\nfor incident response. However, the flexibility and scalability of ICS allow modifications, as needed, based on experience\nand particular incident requirements.\nThese forms are designed to include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address. The use of these\nstandardized ICS Forms is encouraged to promote consistency in the management and documentation of incidents in the\nspirit of NIMS, and to facilitate effective use of mutual aid. In many cases, additional pages can be added to the existing\nICS Forms when needed, and several forms are set up with this specific provision. The section after the ICS Forms List\nprovides details on adding appendixes or fields to the forms for jurisdiction- or discipline-specific needs.\nIt may be appropriate to compile and maintain other NIMS-related forms with these ICS Forms, such as resource\nmanagement and/or ordering forms that are used to support incidents. Examples of these include the following\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) forms: REQ-A (Interstate Mutual Aid Request), Reimbursement\nForm R-1 (Interstate Reimbursement Form), and Reimbursement Form R-2 (Intrastate Reimbursement Form)."

      "text": "ICS FORM ADAPTION, EXTENSION, AND APPENDIXES\nThe ICS Forms in this booklet are designed to serve all-hazards, cross-discipline needs for incident management across\nthe Nation. These forms include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address, and create a foundation\nwithin ICS for complex incident management activities. However, the flexibility and scalability of NIMS should allow for\nneeds outside this foundation, so the following are possible mechanisms to add to, extend, or adapt ICS Forms when\nneeded.\nBecause the goal of NIMS is to have a consistent nationwide approach to incident management, jurisdictions and\ndisciplines are encouraged to use the ICS Forms as they are presented here – unless these forms do not meet an\norganization’s particular incident management needs for some unique reason. If changes are needed, the focus on\nessential information elements should remain, and as such the spirit and intent of particular fields or “information\nelements” on the ICS Forms should remain intact to maintain consistency if the forms are altered. Modifications should be\nclearly indicated as deviations from or additions to the ICS Forms. The following approaches may be used to meet any\nunique needs.\nICS Form Adaptation\nWhen agencies and organizations require specialized forms or information for particular kinds of incidents, events, or\ndisciplines, it may be beneficial to utilize the essential data elements from a particular ICS Form to create a more localized\nor field-specific form. When this occurs, organizations are encouraged to use the relevant essential data elements and\nICS Form number, but to clarify that the altered form is a specific organizational adaptation of the form. For example, an\naltered form should clearly indicate in the title that it has been changed to meet a specific need, such as “ICS 215A,\nHazard Risk Analysis Worksheet, Adapted for Story County Hazmat Program.”\nExtending ICS Form Fields\nParticular fields on an ICS Form may need to include further breakouts or additional related elements. If such additions\nare needed, the form itself should be clearly labeled as an adapted form (see above), and the additional sub-field\nnumbers should be clearly labeled as unique to the adapted form. Letters or other indicators may be used to label the\nnew sub-fields (if the block does not already include sub-fields).\nExamples of possible field additions are shown below for the ICS 209:\n• Block 2: Incident Number.\n• Block 2A (adapted): Full agency accounting cost charge number for primary authority having jurisdiction.\n• Block 29: Primary Materials or Hazards Involved (hazardous chemicals, fuel types, infectious agents, radiation, etc.).\n• Block 29A (adapted): Indicate specific wildland fire fuel model number.\nCreating ICS Form Appendixes\nCertain ICS Forms may require appendixes to include additional information elements needed by a particular jurisdiction\nor discipline. When an appendix is needed for a given form, it is expected that the jurisdiction or discipline will determine\nstandardized fields for such an appendix and make the form available as needed.\nAny ICS Form appendixes should be clearly labeled with the form name and an indicator that it is a discipline- or\njurisdiction-specific appendix. Appendix field numbering should begin following the last identified block in the\ncorresponding ICS Form."

The ICS 209 contains basic information elements needed to support decisionmaking at all levels above the\nincident to support the incident. Decisionmakers may include the agency having jurisdiction, but also all multiagency\ncoordination system (MACS) elements and parties, such as cooperating and assisting agencies/organizations, dispatch\ncenters, emergency operations centers, administrators, elected officials, and local, tribal, county, State, and Federal\nagencies. Once ICS 209 information has been submitted from the incident, decisionmakers and others at all incident\nsupport and coordination points may transmit and share the information (based on its sensitivity and appropriateness) for\naccess and use at local, regional, State, and national levels as it is needed to facilitate support.\nAccurate and timely completion of the ICS 209 is necessary to identify appropriate resource needs, determine allocation\nof limited resources when multiple incidents occur, and secure additional capability when there are limited resources due\nto constraints of time, distance, or other factors. The information included on the ICS 209 influences the priority of the\nincident, and thus its share of available resources and incident support.\nThe ICS 209 is designed to provide a “snapshot in time” to effectively move incident decision support information where it\nis needed. It should contain the most accurate and up-to-date information available at the time it is prepared. However,\nreaders of the ICS 209 may have access to more up-to-date or real-time information in reference to certain information\nelements on the ICS 209. Coordination among communications and information management elements within ICS and\namong MACS should delineate authoritative sources for more up-to-date and/or real-time information when ICS 209\ninformation becomes outdated in a quickly evolving incident.\nReporting Requirements. The ICS 209 is intended to be used when an incident reaches a certain threshold where it\nbecomes significant enough to merit special attention, require additional resource support needs, or cause media\nattention, increased public safety threat, etc. Agencies or organizations may set reporting requirements and, therefore,\nICS 209s should be completed according to each jurisdiction or discipline’s policies, mobilization guide, or preparedness\nplans. It is recommended that consistent ICS 209 reporting parameters be adopted and used by jurisdictions or\ndisciplines for consistency over time, documentation, efficiency, trend monitoring, incident tracking, etc.\nFor example, an agency or MAC (Multiagency Coordination) Group may require the submission of an initial ICS 209 when\na new incident has reached a certain predesignated level of significance, such as when a given number of resources are\ncommitted to the incident, when a new incident is not completed within a certain timeframe, or when impacts/threats to life\nand safety reach a given level.\nTypically, ICS 209 forms are completed either once daily or for each operational period – in addition to the initial\nsubmission. Jurisdictional or organizational guidance may indicate frequency of ICS 209 submission for particular\ndefinitions of incidents or for all incidents. This specific guidance may help determine submission timelines when\noperational periods are extremely short (e.g., 2 hours) and it is not necessary to submit new ICS 209 forms for all\noperational periods.\nAny plans or guidelines should also indicate parameters for when it is appropriate to stop submitting ICS 209s for an\nincident, based upon incident activity and support levels.\nPreparation. When an Incident Management Organization (such as an Incident Management Team) is in place, the\nSituation Unit Leader or Planning Section Chief prepares the ICS 209 at the incident. On other incidents, the ICS 209\nmay be completed by a dispatcher in the local communications center, or by another staff person or manager. This form\nshould be completed at the incident or at the closest level to the incident.\nThe ICS 209 should be completed with the best possible, currently available, and verifiable information at the time it is\ncompleted and signed.\nThis form is designed to serve incidents impacting specific geographic areas that can easily be defined. It also has the\nflexibility for use on ubiquitous events, or those events that cover extremely large areas and that may involve many\njurisdictions and ICS organizations. For these incidents, it will be useful to clarify on the form exactly which portion of the\nlarger incident the ICS 209 is meant to address. For example, a particular ICS 209 submitted during a statewide outbreak\nof mumps may be relevant only to mumps-related activities in Story County, Iowa. This can be indicated in both the\nincident name, Block 1, and in the Incident Location Information section in Blocks 16–26."

      "text": "While most of the “Incident Location Information” in Blocks 16–26 is optional, the more information that can be submitted,\nthe better. Submission of multiple location indicators increases accuracy, improves interoperability, and increases\ninformation sharing between disparate systems. Preparers should be certain to follow accepted protocols or standards\nwhen entering location information, and clearly label all location information. As with other ICS 209 data, geospatial\ninformation may be widely shared and utilized, so accuracy is essential.\nIf electronic data is submitted with the ICS 209, do not attach or send extremely large data files. Incident geospatial data\nthat is distributed with the ICS 209 should be in simple incident geospatial basics, such as the incident perimeter, point of\norigin, etc. Data file sizes should be small enough to be easily transmitted through dial-up connections or other limited\ncommunications capabilities when ICS 209 information is transmitted electronically. Any attached data should be clearly\nlabeled as to format content and collection time, and should follow existing naming conventions and standards.\nDistribution. ICS 209 information is meant to be completed at the level as close to the incident as possible, preferably at\nthe incident. Once the ICS 209 has been submitted outside the incident to a dispatch center or MACS element, it may\nsubsequently be transmitted to various incident supports and coordination entities based on the support needs and the\ndecisions made within the MACS in which the incident occurs.\nCoordination with public information system elements and investigative/intelligence information organizations at the\nincident and within MACS is essential to protect information security and to ensure optimal information sharing and\ncoordination. There may be times in which particular ICS 209s contain sensitive information that should not be released\nto the public (such as information regarding active investigations, fatalities, etc.). When this occurs, the ICS 209 (or\nrelevant sections of it) should be labeled appropriately, and care should be taken in distributing the information within\nMACS.\nAll completed and signed original ICS 209 forms MUST be given to the incident’s Documentation Unit and/or maintained\nas part of the official incident record.\nNotes:\n• To promote flexibility, only a limited number of ICS 209 blocks are typically required, and most of those are required\nonly when applicable.\n• Most fields are optional, to allow responders to use the form as best fits their needs and protocols for information\ncollection.\n• For the purposes of the ICS 209, responders are those personnel who are assigned to an incident or who are a part of\nthe response community as defined by NIMS. This may include critical infrastructure owners and operators,\nnongovernmental and nonprofit organizational personnel, and contract employees (such as caterers), depending on\nlocal/jurisdictional/discipline practices.\n• For additional flexibility only pages 1–3 are numbered, for two reasons:\nPossible submission of additional pages for the Remarks Section (Block 47), and\no\nPossible submission of additional copies of the fourth/last page (the “Incident Resource Commitment Summary”) to\no\nprovide a more detailed resource summary.\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n*1 Incident Name REQUIRED BLOCK.\n• Enter the full name assigned to the incident.\n• Check spelling of the full incident name.\n• For an incident that is a Complex, use the word “Complex” at the end of\nthe incident name.\n• If the name changes, explain comments in Remarks, Block 47.\n• Do not use the same incident name for different incidents in the same\ncalendar year."

Check-in consists\nof reporting specific information, which is recorded on the Check-In List (ICS 211). The ICS 211 serves several purposes,\nas it: (1) records arrival times at the incident of all overhead personnel and equipment, (2) records the initial location of\npersonnel and equipment to facilitate subsequent assignments, and (3) supports demobilization by recording the home\nbase, method of travel, etc., for resources checked in.\nPreparation. The ICS 211 is initiated at a number of incident locations including: Staging Areas, Base, and Incident\nCommand Post (ICP). Preparation may be completed by: (1) overhead at these locations, who record the information\nand give it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (2) the Incident Communications Center Manager located in the\nCommunications Center, who records the information and gives it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (3) a\nrecorder from the Resources Unit during check-in to the ICP. As an option, the ICS 211 can be printed on colored paper\nto match the designated Resource Status Card (ICS 219) colors. The purpose of this is to aid the process of completing a\nlarge volume of ICS 219s.

Open Actions Tracker\n1.Is used by the Incident Commander/Unified Command (IC/UC) to assign and track tasks/actions to IMT\npersonnel that do not rise to the level of being an Incident Objective.\n2.Is duplicated and provided to Command and General Staff members, giving them the open\ntasks/actions needing to be completed and a means to track the open tasks/actions they have been\nassigned.\nNote: This form may also be used by Command and General Staff for tracking tasks/actions within a\nSection/Staff element.\nPreparation. The Planning Section Chief (PSC) is responsible for maintaining the Open Actions Tracker\nfor the IC/UC and typically utilizes the Documentation Unit Leader (DOCL) to assist in this forms\ndevelopment and updating. The PSC should ensure all Command and General Staff are prepared to\ndiscuss their assigned tasks/actions during the Command and General Staff and Planning Meetings.\nDistribution. When completed, the form is duplicated and copies are distributed to the Unified Command\nand Command and General Staff. It is also posted on a status board located at the ICP. All completed\noriginal forms MUST be given to the Documentation Unit.\nItem # Item Title Instructions\n1. Incident Name Enter the name assigned to the incident.\n2. No. Enter number of task in sequential order (1, 2, 3, …).\n3. Item Enter short descriptive of the task/action to be completed. Tasks/Actions\nare important to be completed but are not an Incident Objective which\nare documented on the ICS-202 form.\n4. For/POC Enter the Point of Contact (POC), the responsible person/section.\n5. Briefed to POC Enter “X”, when the task/action has been briefed to the POC/responsible\nperson. This is to ensure that tasks/actions identified outside of the\nPOC’s presence (during Unified Command Meeting for example) are\nbriefed to and acknowledged by the identified POC.\n6. Start Date Enter the date the task/action was initially assigned under “Start Date.”\n7. Status Enter status of item. For example; “Awaiting LE Gear”, “Update\nneeded”, “Awaiting Feedback”. When the item is completed, the word\n“completed” is entered and if working in MS Excel, the task is cut and\npasted into the worksheet labeled “COMPLETED.”\n8. Target Date Enter deadline task/action should be completed. In the Excel\nWorksheet, there is a hidden formula that shows green, yellow and red\nblocks. When the target date is one day away, the block turns yellow.\nWhen it is overdue it turns red. When the block is yellow, it serves as a\nreminder to the UC/POC that the target date is nearing and the POC\nneeds to complete the task or the target date needs to be updated.\n9. Actual Date Enter actual date task/action completed.\nNOTE: In order to ensure the red and yellow reminders work for new tasks, the user simply copies a task\nline, inserts it into the worksheet and overtypes the new task information."

      "content": "The National Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS) Forms Booklet, FEMA 502-2, is\ndesigned to assist emergency response personnel in the use of ICS and corresponding documentation during incident\noperations. This booklet is a companion document to the NIMS ICS Field Operations Guide (FOG), FEMA 502-1, which\nprovides general guidance to emergency responders on implementing ICS. This booklet is meant to complement existing\nincident management programs and does not replace relevant emergency operations plans, laws, and ordinances. These\nforms are designed for use within the Incident Command System, and are not targeted for use in Area Command or in\nmultiagency coordination systems.\nThese forms are intended for use as tools for the creation of Incident Action Plans (IAPs), for other incident management\nactivities, and for support and documentation of ICS activities. Personnel using the forms should have a basic\nunderstanding of NIMS, including ICS, through training and/or experience to ensure they can effectively use and\nunderstand these forms. These ICS Forms represent an all-hazards approach and update to previously used ICS Forms.\nWhile the layout and specific blocks may have been updated, the functionality of the forms remains the same. It is\nrecommended that all users familiarize themselves with the updated forms and instructions.\nA general description of each ICS Form’s purpose, suggested preparation, and distribution are included immediately after\nthe form, including block-by-block completion instructions to ensure maximum clarity on specifics, or for those personnel\nwho may be unfamiliar with the forms.\nThe ICS organizational charts contained in these forms are examples of how an ICS organization is typically developed\nfor incident response. However, the flexibility and scalability of ICS allow modifications, as needed, based on experience\nand particular incident requirements.\nThese forms are designed to include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address. The use of these\nstandardized ICS Forms is encouraged to promote consistency in the management and documentation of incidents in the\nspirit of NIMS, and to facilitate effective use of mutual aid. In many cases, additional pages can be added to the existing\nICS Forms when needed, and several forms are set up with this specific provision. The section after the ICS Forms List\nprovides details on adding appendixes or fields to the forms for jurisdiction- or discipline-specific needs.\nIt may be appropriate to compile and maintain other NIMS-related forms with these ICS Forms, such as resource\nmanagement and/or ordering forms that are used to support incidents. Examples of these include the following\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) forms: REQ-A (Interstate Mutual Aid Request), Reimbursement\nForm R-1 (Interstate Reimbursement Form), and Reimbursement Form R-2 (Intrastate Reimbursement Form).",

These forms include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address, and create a foundation\nwithin ICS for complex incident management activities. However, the flexibility and scalability of NIMS should allow for\nneeds outside this foundation, so the following are possible mechanisms to add to, extend, or adapt ICS Forms when\nneeded.\nBecause the goal of NIMS is to have a consistent nationwide approach to incident management, jurisdictions and\ndisciplines are encouraged to use the ICS Forms as they are presented here – unless these forms do not meet an\norganization’s particular incident management needs for some unique reason. If changes are needed, the focus on\nessential information elements should remain, and as such the spirit and intent of particular fields or “information\nelements” on the ICS Forms should remain intact to maintain consistency if the forms are altered. Modifications should be\nclearly indicated as deviations from or additions to the ICS Forms. The following approaches may be used to meet any\nunique needs.\nICS Form Adaptation\nWhen agencies and organizations require specialized forms or information for particular kinds of incidents, events, or\ndisciplines, it may be beneficial to utilize the essential data elements from a particular ICS Form to create a more localized\nor field-specific form. When this occurs, organizations are encouraged to use the relevant essential data elements and\nICS Form number, but to clarify that the altered form is a specific organizational adaptation of the form. For example, an\naltered form should clearly indicate in the title that it has been changed to meet a specific need, such as “ICS 215A,\nHazard Risk Analysis Worksheet, Adapted for Story County Hazmat Program.”\nExtending ICS Form Fields\nParticular fields on an ICS Form may need to include further breakouts or additional related elements. If such additions\nare needed, the form itself should be clearly labeled as an adapted form (see above), and the additional sub-field\nnumbers should be clearly labeled as unique to the adapted form. Letters or other indicators may be used to label the\nnew sub-fields (if the block does not already include sub-fields).\nExamples of possible field additions are shown below for the ICS 209:\n• Block 2: Incident Number.\n• Block 2A (adapted): Full agency accounting cost charge number for primary authority having jurisdiction.\n• Block 29: Primary Materials or Hazards Involved (hazardous chemicals, fuel types, infectious agents, radiation, etc.).\n• Block 29A (adapted): Indicate specific wildland fire fuel model number.\nCreating ICS Form Appendixes\nCertain ICS Forms may require appendixes to include additional information elements needed by a particular jurisdiction\nor discipline. When an appendix is needed for a given form, it is expected that the jurisdiction or discipline will determine\nstandardized fields for such an appendix and make the form available as needed.\nAny ICS Form appendixes should be clearly labeled with the form name and an indicator that it is a discipline- or\njurisdiction-specific appendix. Appendix field numbering should begin following the last identified block in the\ncorresponding ICS Form.\n\n\nINCIDENT BRIEFING (ICS 201)\n1.Incident Name: 2.Incident Number: 3.Date/Time Initiated:\nDate: Time:\n4.Map/Sketch (include sketch, showing the total area of operations, the incident site/area, impacted and threatened\nareas, overflight results, trajectories, impacted shorelines, or other graphics depicting situational status and resource\nassignment):\n5.Situation Summary and Health and Safety Briefing (for briefings or transfer of command): Recognize potential\nincident Health and Safety Hazards and develop necessary measures (remove hazard, provide personal protective\nequipment, warn people of the hazard) to protect responders from those hazards.\n6.Prepared by: Name: Position/Title: Signature:\nICS 201, Page 1 Date/Time:\n\n\nINCIDENT BRIEFING (ICS 201)",

The ICS 209 is used for reporting information on significant incidents. It is not intended for every incident, as\nmost incidents are of short duration and do not require scarce resources, significant mutual aid, or additional support and\nattention. The ICS 209 contains basic information elements needed to support decisionmaking at all levels above the\nincident to support the incident. Decisionmakers may include the agency having jurisdiction, but also all multiagency\ncoordination system (MACS) elements and parties, such as cooperating and assisting agencies/organizations, dispatch\ncenters, emergency operations centers, administrators, elected officials, and local, tribal, county, State, and Federal\nagencies. Once ICS 209 information has been submitted from the incident, decisionmakers and others at all incident\nsupport and coordination points may transmit and share the information (based on its sensitivity and appropriateness) for\naccess and use at local, regional, State, and national levels as it is needed to facilitate support.\nAccurate and timely completion of the ICS 209 is necessary to identify appropriate resource needs, determine allocation\nof limited resources when multiple incidents occur, and secure additional capability when there are limited resources due\nto constraints of time, distance, or other factors. The information included on the ICS 209 influences the priority of the\nincident, and thus its share of available resources and incident support.\nThe ICS 209 is designed to provide a “snapshot in time” to effectively move incident decision support information where it\nis needed. It should contain the most accurate and up-to-date information available at the time it is prepared. However,\nreaders of the ICS 209 may have access to more up-to-date or real-time information in reference to certain information\nelements on the ICS 209. Coordination among communications and information management elements within ICS and\namong MACS should delineate authoritative sources for more up-to-date and/or real-time information when ICS 209\ninformation becomes outdated in a quickly evolving incident.\nReporting Requirements. The ICS 209 is intended to be used when an incident reaches a certain threshold where it\nbecomes significant enough to merit special attention, require additional resource support needs, or cause media\nattention, increased public safety threat, etc. Agencies or organizations may set reporting requirements and, therefore,\nICS 209s should be completed according to each jurisdiction or discipline’s policies, mobilization guide, or preparedness\nplans. It is recommended that consistent ICS 209 reporting parameters be adopted and used by jurisdictions or\ndisciplines for consistency over time, documentation, efficiency, trend monitoring, incident tracking, etc.\nFor example, an agency or MAC (Multiagency Coordination) Group may require the submission of an initial ICS 209 when\na new incident has reached a certain predesignated level of significance, such as when a given number of resources are\ncommitted to the incident, when a new incident is not completed within a certain timeframe, or when impacts/threats to life\nand safety reach a given level.\nTypically, ICS 209 forms are completed either once daily or for each operational period – in addition to the initial\nsubmission. Jurisdictional or organizational guidance may indicate frequency of ICS 209 submission for particular\ndefinitions of incidents or for all incidents. This specific guidance may help determine submission timelines when\noperational periods are extremely short (e.g., 2 hours) and it is not necessary to submit new ICS 209 forms for all\noperational periods.\nAny plans or guidelines should also indicate parameters for when it is appropriate to stop submitting ICS 209s for an\nincident, based upon incident activity and support levels.\nPreparation. When an Incident Management Organization (such as an Incident Management Team) is in place, the\nSituation Unit Leader or Planning Section Chief prepares the ICS 209 at the incident. On other incidents, the ICS 209\nmay be completed by a dispatcher in the local communications center, or by another staff person or manager. This form\nshould be completed at the incident or at the closest level to the incident.\nThe ICS 209 should be completed with the best possible, currently available, and verifiable information at the time it is\ncompleted and signed.\nThis form is designed to serve incidents impacting specific geographic areas that can easily be defined. It also has the\nflexibility for use on ubiquitous events, or those events that cover extremely large areas and that may involve many\njurisdictions and ICS organizations. For these incidents, it will be useful to clarify on the form exactly which portion of the\nlarger incident the ICS 209 is meant to address. For example, a particular ICS 209 submitted during a statewide outbreak\nof mumps may be relevant only to mumps-related activities in Story County, Iowa. This can be indicated in both the\nincident name, Block 1, and in the Incident Location Information section in Blocks 16–26.\n\n\nWhile most of the “Incident Location Information” in Blocks 16–26 is optional, the more information that can be submitted,\nthe better. Submission of multiple location indicators increases accuracy, improves interoperability, and increases\ninformation sharing between disparate systems. Preparers should be certain to follow accepted protocols or standards\nwhen entering location information, and clearly label all location information. As with other ICS 209 data, geospatial\ninformation may be widely shared and utilized, so accuracy is essential.\nIf electronic data is submitted with the ICS 209, do not attach or send extremely large data files. Incident geospatial data\nthat is distributed with the ICS 209 should be in simple incident geospatial basics, such as the incident perimeter, point of\norigin, etc. Data file sizes should be small enough to be easily transmitted through dial-up connections or other limited\ncommunications capabilities when ICS 209 information is transmitted electronically. Any attached data should be clearly\nlabeled as to format content and collection time, and should follow existing naming conventions and standards.\nDistribution. ICS 209 information is meant to be completed at the level as close to the incident as possible, preferably at\nthe incident. Once the ICS 209 has been submitted outside the incident to a dispatch center or MACS element, it may\nsubsequently be transmitted to various incident supports and coordination entities based on the support needs and the\ndecisions made within the MACS in which the incident occurs.\nCoordination with public information system elements and investigative/intelligence information organizations at the\nincident and within MACS is essential to protect information security and to ensure optimal information sharing and\ncoordination. There may be times in which particular ICS 209s contain sensitive information that should not be released\nto the public (such as information regarding active investigations, fatalities, etc.). When this occurs, the ICS 209 (or\nrelevant sections of it) should be labeled appropriately, and care should be taken in distributing the information within\nMACS.\nAll completed and signed original ICS 209 forms MUST be given to the incident’s Documentation Unit and/or maintained\nas part of the official incident record.\nNotes:\n• To promote flexibility, only a limited number of ICS 209 blocks are typically required, and most of those are required\nonly when applicable.\n• Most fields are optional, to allow responders to use the form as best fits their needs and protocols for information\ncollection.\n• For the purposes of the ICS 209, responders are those personnel who are assigned to an incident or who are a part of\nthe response community as defined by NIMS. This may include critical infrastructure owners and operators,\nnongovernmental and nonprofit organizational personnel, and contract employees (such as caterers), depending on\nlocal/jurisdictional/discipline practices.\n• For additional flexibility only pages 1–3 are numbered, for two reasons:\nPossible submission of additional pages for the Remarks Section (Block 47), and\no\nPossible submission of additional copies of the fourth/last page (the “Incident Resource Commitment Summary”) to\no\nprovide a more detailed resource summary.\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n*1 Incident Name REQUIRED BLOCK.\n• Enter the full name assigned to the incident.\n• Check spelling of the full incident name.\n• For an incident that is a Complex, use the word “Complex” at the end of\nthe incident name.\n• If the name changes, explain comments in Remarks, Block 47.\n• Do not use the same incident name for different incidents in the same\ncalendar year.\n\n\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n2 Incident Number • Enter the appropriate number based on current guidance. The incident\nnumber may vary by jurisdiction and discipline.\n• Examples include:\nA computer-aided dispatch (CAD) number.\no\nAn accounting number.\no\nA county number.\no\nA disaster declaration number.\no\nA combination of the State, unit/agency ID, and a dispatch system\no\nnumber.\nA mission number.\no\nAny other unique number assigned to the incident and derived by\no\nmeans other than those above.\n• Make sure the number entered is correct.\n• Do not use the same incident number for two different incidents in the\nsame calendar year.\n• Incident numbers associated with host jurisdictions or agencies and\nincident numbers assigned by agencies represented in Unified Command\nshould be listed, or indicated in Remarks, Block 47.\n*3 Report Version (check REQUIRED BLOCK.\none box on left) • This indicates the current version of the ICS 209 form being submitted.\n• If only one ICS 209 will be submitted, check BOTH “Initial” and “Final” (or\ncheck only “Final”).\n Initial Check “Initial” if this is the first ICS 209 for this incident.\n Update Check “Update” if this is a subsequent report for the same incident. These\ncan be submitted at various time intervals (see “Reporting Requirements”\nabove).\n Final • Check “Final” if this is the last ICS 209 to be submitted for this incident\n(usually when the incident requires only minor support that can be\nsupplied by the organization having jurisdiction).\n• Incidents may also be marked as “Final” if they become part of a new\nComplex (when this occurs, it can be indicated in Remarks, Block 47).\nReport # (if used) Use this optional field if your agency or organization requires the tracking of\nICS 209 report numbers. Agencies may also track the ICS 209 by the\ndate/time submitted.\n*4 Incident Commander(s) REQUIRED BLOCK.\n& Agency or • Enter both the first and last name of the Incident Commander.\nOrganization • If the incident is under a Unified Command, list all Incident Commanders\nby first initial and last name separated by a comma, including their\norganization.

Check-in consists\nof reporting specific information, which is recorded on the Check-In List (ICS 211). The ICS 211 serves several purposes,\nas it: (1) records arrival times at the incident of all overhead personnel and equipment, (2) records the initial location of\npersonnel and equipment to facilitate subsequent assignments, and (3) supports demobilization by recording the home\nbase, method of travel, etc., for resources checked in.\nPreparation. The ICS 211 is initiated at a number of incident locations including: Staging Areas, Base, and Incident\nCommand Post (ICP). Preparation may be completed by: (1) overhead at these locations, who record the information\nand give it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (2) the Incident Communications Center Manager located in the\nCommunications Center, who records the information and gives it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (3) a\nrecorder from the Resources Unit during check-in to the ICP. As an option, the ICS 211 can be printed on colored paper\nto match the designated Resource Status Card (ICS 219) colors. The purpose of this is to aid the process of completing a\nlarge volume of ICS 219s. The ICS 219 colors are:\n• 219-1: Header Card – Gray (used only as label cards for T-Card racks)\n• 219-2: Crew/Team Card – Green\n• 219-3: Engine Card – Rose\n• 219-4: Helicopter Card – Blue\n• 219-5: Personnel Card – White\n• 219-6: Fixed-Wing Card – Orange\n• 219-7: Equipment Card – Yellow\n• 219-8: Miscellaneous Equipment/Task Force Card – Tan\n• 219-10: Generic Card – Light Purple\nDistribution.

Resource Status Cards (ICS 219) are also known as “T-Cards,” and are used by the Resources Unit to record\nstatus and location information on resources, transportation, and support vehicles and personnel. These cards provide a\nvisual display of the status and location of resources assigned to the incident.\nPreparation. Information to be placed on the cards may be obtained from several sources including, but not limited to:\n• Incident Briefing (ICS 201).\n• Incident Check-In List (ICS 211).\n• General Message (ICS 213).\n• Agency-supplied information or electronic resource management systems.\nDistribution. ICS 219s are displayed in resource status or “T-Card” racks where they can be easily viewed, retrieved,\nupdated, and rearranged. The Resources Unit typically maintains cards for resources assigned to an incident until\ndemobilization. At demobilization, all cards should be turned in to the Documentation Unit.\nNotes. There are eight different status cards (see list below) and a header card, to be printed front-to-back on cardstock.\nEach card is printed on a different color of cardstock and used for a different resource category/kind/type. The format and\ncontent of information on each card varies depending upon the intended use of the card.\n• 219-1: Header Card – Gray (used only as label cards for T-Card racks)\n• 219-2: Crew/Team Card – Green\n• 219-3: Engine Card – Rose\n• 219-4: Helicopter Card – Blue\n• 219-5: Personnel Card – White\n• 219-6: Fixed-Wing Card – Orange\n• 219-7: Equipment Card – Yellow\n• 219-8: Miscellaneous Equipment/Task Force Card – Tan\n• 219-10: Generic Card – Light Purple\nAcronyms.
