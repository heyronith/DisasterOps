NIMS provides the template for the management of incidents, while the NRF\nprovides the structure and mechanisms for national-level policy for incident\nmanagement.\nThis course introduces and overviews the NIMS. NIMS provides a consistent\nnationwide template to enable the whole community – all government, private-sector,\nand nongovernmental organizations – to work together during domestic incidents.\nPlan Of Instruction 1\n\n\nJune 2020 POI - IS-0700.b NIMS National Incident Management System, an Introduction\nGOAL\nThe goal of this professional development course, IS-700 National Incident\nManagement System (NIMS) Introduction, is to provide training and resources for\nFEMA personnel who require a basic understanding of NIMS.\nCOURSE OBJECTIVES\nUpon completion of this course, participants will be able to:\n• Describe and identify key concepts, principles, scope, and applicability underlying\nNIMS.\n• Describe activities and methods for managing resources.\n• Describe the NIMS Management Characteristics.\n• Identify and describe Incident Command System (ICS) organizational structures.\n• Explain Emergency Operations Center (EOC) functions, common models for staff\norganization, and activation levels.\n• Explain the interconnectivity within the NIMS Management and Coordination\nstructures: ICS, EOC, Joint Information System (JIS), and Multiagency Coordination\nGroups (MAC Groups).\n• Identify and describe the characteristics of communications and information\nsystems, effective communication, incident information, and communication\nstandards and formats.\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nThe intended audience includes a wide range of individuals with emergency\nmanagement responsibilities in the five mission areas (prevention, preparedness,\nresponse, recovery and mitigation). This may include government executives, private-\nsector and nongovernmental organization (NGO) leaders, and emergency management\npractitioners.

NIMS provides the template for the management of incidents, while the NRF\nprovides the structure and mechanisms for national-level policy for incident\nmanagement.\nThis course introduces and overviews the NIMS. NIMS provides a consistent\nnationwide template to enable the whole community – all government, private-sector,\nand nongovernmental organizations – to work together during domestic incidents.\nPlan Of Instruction 1\n\n\nJune 2020 POI - IS-0700.b NIMS National Incident Management System, an Introduction\nGOAL\nThe goal of this professional development course, IS-700 National Incident\nManagement System (NIMS) Introduction, is to provide training and resources for\nFEMA personnel who require a basic understanding of NIMS.",
