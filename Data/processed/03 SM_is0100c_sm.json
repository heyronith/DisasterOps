The\nFederal Government is only one part of the\nwhole community.\nThe Whole Community approach ensures\nsolutions that serve the entire community\nare implemented, while simultaneously\nmaking sure that the resources the different\nmembers of the community bring to the\ntable are used efficiently. These members\ninclude those in all levels of government as\nwell as those in non-governmental and\nprivate-sector organizations in fields such\nas transportation, health care, schools,\npublic works, communications, agriculture,\nchemical/nuclear, and more.\nAs part of the whole community, you will need to understand your role\nin the Incident Command System (ICS) and how ICS works to help\neveryone involved. This course will help in that regard.\nThis course addresses all disciplines that use ICS across the\nNote\ncommunity. In addition, Unit 4 handouts provide discipline-specific\nexamples of ICS applications, such as Public Works, Schools, and\nUtilities. Unit 5 incorporates a variety of disciplines in a series of\nscenarios.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-14\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 12: What is the Incident Command\nSystem?\nThe Incident Command System\n(ICS) is a standardized approach to\nincident management that:\n• Is used for all kinds of incidents\nby all types of organizations and\nat all levels of government; ICS\nis applicable to small incidents\nas well as large and complex\nones.\n• Can be used not only for\nemergencies, but also for\nplanned events.\n• Enables a coordinated response\namong various jurisdictions and\nagencies.\n• Establishes common processes\nfor incident-level planning and\nresource management.\n• Allows for the incorporation of\nresources (such as facilities,\nequipment, personnel) within a\ncommon organizational\nstructure.\nICS - Brief History\nICS was developed in the 1970s following a series of catastrophic\nfires in California. Property damage ran into the millions, and many\npeople died or were injured.\nNote\nThe personnel assigned to study the case histories and determine\nthe causes of these disasters discovered that response problems\ncould rarely be attributed to lack of resources or failure of tactics.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-15\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 13: When is ICS Used?\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) can be\nused to manage any type of incident, including\na planned event (e.g., the Olympics, the\nGovernor's inauguration, state fairs, a local\nparade, etc.). The use of ICS is applicable to all\ntypes of incidents, regardless of their size or\ncause.\nAs a system, ICS is extremely useful. Not only\ndoes it provide an organizational structure for\nincident management, but it also guides the\nprocess for planning, building, and adapting that\nstructure.\nUsing ICS for every incident or planned\nevent provides the practice that will help to\nmaintain and improve skills needed to\neffectively coordinate larger or more\ncomplex efforts.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-16\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 14: ICS for Planned Events\nFrom your own experiences, what are some examples of different types of planned\nevents where ICS was used?\nWhy was it beneficial to use ICS?\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-17\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 15: Incident Command System:\nPromoting Response Partnerships\nIncident Command System: Promoting Response Partnerships\nThe following video will introduce ICS and describe its importance.\nVideo Duration: 1 minute, 30 seconds\nVideo\nIncident Command System: Promoting Response Partnerships\nVideo Transcript:\nDisaster can strike anytime, anywhere. It takes many forms—a hurricane, an\nearthquake, a tornado, a flood, a fire or a hazardous spill, or an act of terrorism. An\nincident can build over days or weeks, or hit suddenly, without warning.\nA poorly managed incident response can undermine our safety and wellbeing. With so\nmuch at stake, we must effectively manage our response efforts.\nAlthough most incidents are handled locally, partnerships among local, tribal, State, and\nFederal agencies as well as nongovernmental and private-sector organizations may be\nrequired.\nAs partners, we must respond together in a seamless, coordinated fashion.\nThe Incident Command System, or ICS, helps ensure incorporation of our response\nefforts. ICS is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazards approach to incident management.\nICS allows all responders to adopt an integrated organizational structure that matches\nthe complexities and demands of the incident while respecting agency and jurisdictional\nauthorities. Although ICS promotes standardization, it is not without needed flexibility.\nFor example, the ICS organizational structure can expand or contract to meet incident\nneeds.\nIn this course, you’ll learn ICS principles. And more importantly, you’ll learn to interface\nbetter with your response partners.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-18\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 16: ICS as a Component of the National\nIncident Management System (NIMS)\nThe National Incident\nManagement System (NIMS) is a\nsystematic, proactive approach to\nguide all levels of government,\nnongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs), and the private sector to\nwork together to prevent, protect\nagainst, mitigate, respond to, and\nrecover from the effects of\nincidents. NIMS provides a\nconsistent foundation for all\nincidents, ranging from daily\noccurrences to incidents requiring\na coordinated Federal response.\nNIMS is organized into three major\ncomponents:\n• Resource Management\n• Command and Coordination\n- including the Incident\nCommand System\n• Communications and\nInformation Management\nIt is important to note that the\nIncident Command System (ICS)\nis just one part of NIMS.\nNational Preparedness and ICS Requirements\nReview the following points about the value of using ICS:\n• ICS works! It saves lives! Life safety is the top priority for ICS\nNote response.\n• The use of ICS is a key indicator of National Incident Management\nSystem (NIMS) implementation. Jurisdictions that receive some\nFederal grants such as National Preparedness Grants must\ndemonstrate NIMS implementation. NIMS provides a systematic,\nproactive approach guiding departments and agencies at all levels\nof government, the private sector, and nongovernmental\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-19\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\norganizations to work seamlessly to prevent, protect against,\nrespond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents,\nregardless of cause, size, location, or complexity, in order to\nreduce the loss of life and property, and harm to the environment.\nIn addition to the NIMS mandate, the following laws require the use of\nICS:\n• The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of\n1986 established Federal regulations for handling hazardous\nmaterials. SARA directed the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA) to establish rules for operations at\nhazardous materials incidents.\n• OSHA rule 1910.120, effective March 6, 1990, requires all\norganizations that handle hazardous materials to use ICS. The\nregulation states: “The Incident Command System shall be\nestablished by those employers for the incidents that will be under\ntheir control and shall interface with other organizations or\nagencies who may respond to such an incident.”\nNote that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires States\nto use ICS at hazardous materials incidents.\nAccording to the National Integration Center, “institutionalizing the use\nof ICS” means that government officials, incident managers, and\nemergency response organizations at all jurisdictional levels must\nadopt ICS. Actions to institutionalize the use of ICS take place at two\nlevels:\n• Policy Level: At the policy level, institutionalizing ICS means\ngovernment officials (i.e., Governors, mayors, county and city\nmanagers, tribal leaders, and others) must:\n• Adopt ICS through executive order, proclamation, or legislation\nas the jurisdiction's official incident response system; and\n• Direct that incident managers and response organizations in\ntheir jurisdictions train, exercise, and use ICS in their response\noperations.\n• Organizational Level: At the organizational/operational level,\nevidence that incident managers and emergency response\norganizations are institutionalizing ICS would include the following:\n• ICS is being integrated into functional and system-wide\nemergency operations policies, plans, and procedures.\n• ICS training is planned or underway for responders,\nsupervisors, and command-level officers.\n• Responders at all levels are participating in and/or coordinating\nICS-oriented exercises that involve responders from multiple\ndisciplines and jurisdictions.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-20\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nNational Preparedness and ICS\nNIMS represents a core set of doctrine, concepts, principles,\nterminology, and organizational processes that enables effective,\nefficient, and collaborative incident management.\nNote\n• Resource Management: Resource Management describes\nstandard mechanisms to systematically manage resources,\nincluding personnel, equipment, supplies, teams, and facilities,\nboth before and during incidents in order to allow organizations to\nmore effectively share resources when needed.\n• Command and Coordination: Command and Coordination\ndescribes leadership roles, processes, and recommended\norganizational structures for incident management at the\noperational and incident support levels and explains how these\nstructures interact to manage incidents effectively and efficiently.\n• Communications and Information Management: Communications\nand Information Management describes systems and methods that\nhelp to ensure that incident personnel and other decision makers\nhave the means and information they need to make and\ncommunicate decisions.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-21\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 17: Incident Response Problems\nWhat are some common causes of incident response problems?\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-22\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 18: ICS Benefits - Student Activity\nActivity Purpose: The purpose of this activity is to discuss the benefits of ICS.\nInstructions: Follow the steps below to conduct this activity:\n1.

These characteristics are the foundation of all\nNIMS command and coordination components, including the Incident Command\nSystem (ICS).\nObjective:\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n• Describe the 14 NIMS management characteristics.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-43\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 2: Making ICS Work\nEffective incident management relies\non a common organizational structure\nfor managing resources, making\ndecisions, and assigning tasks. The\nIncident Command System (ICS) uses\na standardized management approach\nto ensure that incidents are properly\nmanaged and communications are\neffectively coordinated during an\nincident.\nAs an incident occurs, you may be\ncalled upon to assist -- making you a\npart of this organizational structure. To\nensure success, you should\nunderstand how this structure works.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-44\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 3: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nNIMS Management Characteristics\nThe following video will introduce the NIMS Management\nCharacteristics discussed in detail in this unit.\nVideo Video Duration: 2 minutes, 30 seconds\nNIMS Management Characteristics: Overview\nVideo Transcript\nAs you learned in the previous lesson, ICS is based on proven NIMS management\nprinciples, which contribute to the strength and efficiency of the overall system.\nICS incorporates a wide range of management features and principles, beginning with\nthe use of common terminology.\n[David Burns, Emergency Preparedness Manager, University of California Los Angeles]\nCommunication is probably one of the most essential elements of ICS. It’s important\nthat we know how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River\nAuthority] If the terms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to\nhave a hard time communicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our\nmission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance\non an Incident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your\nend objective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So\nyou can establish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan,\nand you can ensure that they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established\nunder a single Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-45\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management\nOffice] One of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the\nsame framework.\nICS helps ensure full utilization of all incident resources by:\n• Maintaining a manageable span of control\n• Establishing designated incident facilities and locations\n• Implementing comprehensive resource management practices\n• Defining clear processes for dispatch/ deployment of resources\n• Ensuring integrated communications\nICS supports responders and decision makers through effective information and\nintelligence management.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] The common\noperating picture is a critical thing that the Coast Guard has been working hard on\nrecently for ourselves because it’s something that helps us maintain a better operational\npicture and it’s more consistent across the board, everyone up and down the chain of\ncommand and across to other agencies understand the same picture.\nICS counts on each of us taking personal accountability for our own actions. And\nfinally, the mobilization process helps ensure that incident objectives can be achieved\nwhile responders remain safe.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] To have NIMS\nwork effectively, it’s got to be top-down support.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics covered in this lesson form the basis for\neffective, team-based incident response under the Incident Command System (ICS).\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-46\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 4: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) is based on the following 14 proven NIMS\nmanagement characteristics, each of which contributes to the strength and efficiency of\nthe overall system:\n• Integrated Communications\n• Common Terminology\n• Establishment and Transfer of\n• Modular Organization\nCommand\n• Management by Objectives\n• Unified Command\n• Incident Action Planning\n• Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Manageable Span of Control\nCommand\n• Incident Facilities and Locations\n• Accountability\n• Comprehensive Resource\n• Dispatch/Deployment\nManagement\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-47\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 5: Common Terminology\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) establishes Common\nTerminology that allows different incident management and\nsupport organizations to work together across a wide variety\nof emergency functions and hazard scenarios. This common\nterminology covers the following:\n• Organizational Functions: Major functions and functional\nunits with incident management responsibilities are named\nand defined. They remain standard and consistent.\n• Resource Descriptions: Major resources – including\npersonnel, equipment, teams, and facilities – are given\ncommon names and are “typed” with respect to their\ncapabilities.\n• Incident Facilities: Common terminology is used to\ndesignate the facilities in the vicinity of the incident area.\nDuring an incident:\n• Communications should use common terms.\n• Organizations should avoid radio codes, agency-specific\ncodes, acronyms, or jargon. Usage of these types of codes\nmay cause confusion or possibly compromise life safety\ndue to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation.\nThe goal is to promote understanding among all parties\ninvolved in managing an incident.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-48\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 6: Common Terminology Discussion\nEven if you use codes on a daily basis, why should you use common terminology\nduring an incident response?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-49\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 7: Modular Organization\nThe Incident Command System (ICS)\norganizational structure develops in a\nmodular fashion based on the\nincident’s size and complexity.\n• The responsibility for the\nestablishment and expansion of the\nICS modular organization rests with\nthe Incident Commander.\n• As the incident grows more\ncomplex, the ICS organization may\nexpand as functional responsibilities\nare delegated.\nICS Organizational Structure\nThe ICS organizational structure develops in a top-down, modular\nfashion that is based on the size and complexity of the incident, as\nwell as the specifics of the hazard environment created by the\nNote\nincident. As incident complexity increases, the organization expands\nfrom the top down as functional responsibilities are delegated.\nThe ICS organizational structure is flexible. When needed, separate\nfunctional elements can be established and subdivided to enhance\ninternal organizational management and external coordination. As the\nICS organizational structure expands, the number of management\npositions also expands to adequately address the requirements of the\nincident.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-50\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 8: Management by Objectives\nThe Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand (which will be discussed\nlater), establishes incident objectives\nthat drive incident operations.\nManagement by Objectives includes\nthe following:\n• Establishing specific, measurable\nincident objectives.\n• Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks\nand activities to achieve the\nobjectives.\n• Developing and issuing\nassignments, plans, procedures,\nand protocols to accomplish\nidentified tasks.\n• Documenting results for the incident\nobjectives.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-51\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 9: Incident Action Planning\nIncident action planning guides effective incident\nmanagement activities. An Incident Action Plan (IAP)\nis a concise, coherent means of capturing and\ncommunicating overall incident priorities, objectives,\nstrategies, tactics, and assignments in the context of\nboth operational and support activities. The IAP should\nfocus on addressing the needs of future timeframes\n(called operational periods).\nTo be effective, an IAP should:\n• Cover a specified timeframe\n• Be proactive\n• Specify the incident objectives\n• State the activities to be completed\n• Assign responsibilities\n• Identify needed resources\n• Specify communication protocols\nFor smaller/less complex incidents, the IAP may be\noral or written, except for hazardous materials\nincidents, which require a written IAP. FEMA has\ndeveloped a series of ICS Forms for use in developing\na written IAP.\nIncident Action Plan\nEvery response has a strategy—like a lesson plan—called an Incident\nAction Plan (IAP).\nNote To be effective, an IAP should:\n• Cover a specified timeframe\n• Be proactive\n• Specify the incident objectives\n• State the activities to be completed\n• Assign responsibilities\n• Identify needed resources\n• Specify communication protocols\nEven the smallest of incidents are managed by incident objectives\nand plans. The plan can be as simple as the next steps the Incident\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-52\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nCommander plans to do. The steps can be orally communicated to\nthe rest of the ICS organization.\nIncident Action Plan Questions\nEvery IAP must answer the following four questions:\n• What do we want to do?\nNote • Who is responsible for doing it?\n• How do we communicate with each other?\n• What is the procedure if someone is injured?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-53\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 10: Incident Action Plan - Activity 2.1\nActivity Purpose: To illustrate how to develop an IAP.\nInstructions: Working in groups:\n1.

This ratio is a guideline--incident\npersonnel should use their best\njudgement to determine the appropriate\nratio for an incident.\nIf too much responsibility is given to the supervisor, the span of\ncontrol may become unmanageable. A manageable span of control\non incidents may actually vary depending upon the type of incident,\nnature of the task, hazards and safety factors, and distances between\nNote\npersonnel and resources.\nMaintaining a manageable span of control is particularly important at\nincidents where safety and accountability are a top priority.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-55\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 12: Manageable Span of Control\nDiscussion\nWhat are some examples of when span of control is most critical?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-56\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 13: Incident Facilities and Locations\nDepending upon the incident size and\ncomplexity, various types of support\nfacilities may be established by\nIncident Command.

Unified Command allows\nagencies with different legal,\ngeographic, and functional\nresponsibilities to work together\neffectively without affecting individual\nagency authority, responsibility, or\naccountability.\nUnified Command is typically\nestablished when no single\njurisdiction, agency or organization\nhas the authority and/or resources to\nmanage the incident on its own.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-64\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 21: Chain of Command\nChain of command is an orderly line that details how\nauthority flows through the hierarchy of the incident\nmanagement organization. Chain of command:\n• Allows an Incident Commander to direct and\ncontrol the actions of all personnel on the incident.\n• Avoids confusion by requiring that orders flow from\nsupervisors.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-65\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 22: Unity of Command\nWhile chain of command relates to the overall\nhierarchy of the organization, unity of command deals\nwith the fact that all individuals have a single\ndesignated supervisor they report to.\nBased on the principle of unity of command, you will:\n• Report to only one Incident Command System\n(ICS) supervisor.\n• Receive work assignments only from your ICS\nsupervisor.\nWhen you are assigned to an incident, you no longer\nreport directly to your day-to-day supervisor.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-66\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 23: Accountability\nEffective accountability during incident operations is\nessential. As part of the Incident Command System\n(ICS) structure, you will need to abide by agency\npolicies and guidelines and any applicable local, tribal,\nstate, or Federal rules and regulations.\nThere are several principles you will need to adhere to:\n• Check-In/Check-Out. All responders must report in\nto receive an assignment. Checking out is just as\ncritical as checking in.\n• Incident Action Planning. Response operations\nmust be coordinated as outlined in the Incident\nAction Plan.\n• Unity of Command. Each individual will be assigned\nto only one supervisor.\n• Personal Responsibility. ICS relies on each\nindividual taking personal accountability for his or\nher own actions.\n• Span of Control. Supervisors must be able to\nadequately supervise and control their subordinates,\nas well as communicate with and manage all\nresources under their supervision.\n• Resource Tracking. Supervisors must record and\nreport resource status changes as they occur.\nAccountability starts as soon as a resource is\nrequested through the time that the resource returns\nto their home base safely.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-67\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 24: Dispatch/Deployment\nResources should be deployed only when requested or\nwhen dispatched by an appropriate authority through\nestablished resource management systems.\nResources not requested should refrain from self-\ndispatching to avoid overburdening the incident\ncommand.\nDispatch/Deployment\nAnother key feature of ICS is the importance of managing resources\nto adjust to changing conditions.\nNote When an incident occurs, you must be dispatched or deployed to\nbecome part of the incident response. In other words, until you are\ndeployed to the incident organization, you remain in your everyday\nrole.\nAfter being deployed, your first task is to check in and receive an\nassignment.\nAfter check-in, you will locate your incident supervisor and obtain your\ninitial briefing. The briefings you receive and give should include:\n• Current assessment of the situation.\n• Identification of your specific job responsibilities.\n• Identification of coworkers.\n• Location of work area.\n• Identification of break areas, as appropriate.\n• Procedural instructions for obtaining needed resources.\n• Operational periods/work shifts.\n• Required safety procedures and personal protective equipment\n(PPE), as appropriate.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-68\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 25: Dispatch/Deployment - Activity 2.2\nDispatch/Deployment - Activity 2.2\nInstructions: Working individually:\n• Review the scenario and discussion question presented in the\nStudent Manual.\n• Be prepared to share your answer in 5 minutes.\nTime: 10 minutes\nActivity Scenario: Rosa is an off-duty certified Emergency Medical Technician\nwho lives near the scene of a major structural collapse that has\noccurred in a busy shopping center.

The problem must be\nidentified and assessed, a plan to deal with it\nmust be developed and implemented, and the\nnecessary resources must be procured and\npaid for.\nRegardless of the size of the incident, these\nfunctional areas are all required.\nIn case you ever need to assist with an incident,\nyou should understand how the management\nstructure is constructed using the Incident\nCommand System (ICS). This will help you\nunderstand your role in the structure and how\nyou may receive information and assignments.\nThis unit focuses on the five major functional\nareas and the Command Staff roles. The\nGeneral Staff roles will be discussed in the next\nunit.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-77\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 3: Five Major ICS Functional Areas\nThere are five major Incident Command System\n(ICS) functional areas that are the foundation on\nwhich an incident management organization\ndevelops.\nThese functions apply to incidents of all sizes and\ntypes, including both planned events and ones that\noccur without warning.\nIf you are in an incident and hear these terms, it’s\nimportant for you to know what they mean. For\ninstance, you may be directed to provide\ndocuments to the Planning Section or receipts to\nthe Finance/Administration Section.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-78\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 4: ICS Functional Area Descriptions\nIncident Command: Sets the incident objectives,\nstrategies, and priorities, and has overall\nresponsibility for the incident.\nOperations: Conducts operations to reach the\nincident objectives.

Incident Command, which could be a single\nIncident Commander or a Unified Command, will lead the effort and,\nNote\nas needed, assign Command Staff and General Staff. For the\nremainder of this unit, we will discuss the Incident Command function\nand the members of the Command Staff.\nICS Organization is Unique\nThe ICS organization is unique but easy to understand. There is no\ncorrelation between the ICS organization and the administrative\nstructure of any single agency or jurisdiction.\nFor example, someone who serves as a director every day would not\nnormally use that title when deployed under an ICS structure. They\nwould use the ICS title of the position that they were assigned to\nwithin the ICS structure.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-86\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nThis is deliberate, because confusion over different position titles and\norganizational structures has been a significant stumbling block to\neffective incident management in the past.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-87\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 12: Incident Command Definition\nThe National Incident Management System\n(NIMS) defines command as the act of\ndirecting, ordering, or controlling by virtue of\nexplicit statutory, regulatory, or delegated\nauthority.\nWhen you are using the Incident Command\nSystem (ICS) to manage an incident, an\nIncident Commander is assigned. The Incident\nCommander has the authority to establish\nobjectives, make assignments, and order\nresources. To achieve these ends, the Incident\nCommander works closely with staff and\ntechnical experts to analyze the situation and\nconsider alternative strategies.\nThe Incident Commander should have the\ntraining, experience, and expertise to serve in\nthis capacity. Qualifications to serve as an\nIncident Commander should not be based\nsolely on rank, grade, or technical knowledge.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-88\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 13: Incident Commander\nLet’s begin by taking a closer look at the Incident Commander. The Incident\nCommander is responsible for the overall management of the incident. Overall\nmanagement includes Command Staff assignments required to support the incident\ncommand function. The Incident Commander is the only position that is always\nstaffed in ICS applications. On small incidents and events, one person-the\nIncident Commander-may accomplish all management functions.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-89\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 14: Incident Commander Discussion\nWhy is it critical to establish command from the beginning of an incident?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-90\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 15: Incident Commander Responsibilities\nIn addition to having the overall responsibility\nfor managing the entire incident, the Incident\nCommander is specifically responsible for:\n• Ensuring overall incident safety\n• Providing information services to internal\nand external stakeholders, such as disaster\nsurvivors, agency executives, and senior\nofficials\n• Establishing and maintaining liaisons with\nother agencies participating in the incident\nThe Incident Commander may appoint one or\nmore Deputies. If a Deputy is assigned, he or\nshe should be fully qualified to assume the\nIncident Commander’s position.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-91\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 16: Selecting or Changing Incident\nCommanders\nThe command function should be clearly\nestablished at the beginning of an incident. The\njurisdiction or organization with primary\nresponsibility for an incident designates the\nindividual at the scene who is responsible for\nestablishing command and the protocol for\ntransferring command. As an incident becomes\nmore or less complex, command may change to\nmeet the needs of the incident.\nWhen command is transferred, the process\nshould include a briefing that captures all\nessential information for continuing safe and\neffective operations.\nReasons for Transfer of Command\nThere are several possible reasons that command might be\ntransferred. Transfer of command may take place when:\nNote • A more qualified Incident Commander arrives and assumes\ncommand.\n• A jurisdiction or agency is legally required to take command. For\nexample, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is legally\nrequired to take the lead for investigations of terrorist incidents.\n• The incident changes in complexity. For example, an incident\nmight start in a small area, but spread into the surrounding\ncommunity, affecting multiple jurisdictions, institutions, or\nagencies.\n• The current Incident Commander needs to rest. On long or\nextended incidents, there is normally turnover of personnel to\naccommodate work/rest requirements.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-92\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 17: Transfer of Command Discussion\nThe transfer of command process always includes a thorough transfer of command\nbriefing, which may be oral, written, or a combination of both.\nIt is also important to remember that the rest of the incident staff should be notified of\nthe transfer of command.\nWhat would you include in a transfer of command briefing?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-93\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nTransfer of Command Process\nTransfer of Command Process\nThe process of moving the responsibility for incident command from\none Incident Commander to another is called “transfer of command.”\nIt should be recognized that transition of command on an expanding\nNote\nincident is to be expected. It does not reflect on the competency of the\ncurrent Incident Commander.\nThere are five important actions in effectively assuming command of\nan incident in progress.\n1. The incoming Incident Commander should, if at all possible,\npersonally perform an assessment of the incident situation with the\nexisting Incident Commander.\n2. The incoming Incident Commander must be adequately briefed.\nThis briefing must be by the current Incident Commander, and\ntake place face-to-face if possible. The briefing must cover the\nfollowing:\n• Incident history (what has happened)\n• Priorities and objectives\n• Current plan\n• Resource assignments\n• Incident organization\n• Resources ordered/needed\n• Facilities established\n• Status of communications\n• Any constraints or limitations\n• Incident potential\n• Delegation of authority\n3. After the incident briefing, the incoming Incident Commander\nshould determine an appropriate time for transfer of command.\n4. At the appropriate time, notice of a change in incident command\nshould be made to:\n• Agency headquarters.\n• General Staff members (if designated).\n• Command Staff members (if designated).\n• All incident personnel.\n5. The incoming Incident Commander may give the previous Incident\nCommander another assignment on the incident. There are\nseveral advantages to this strategy:\n• The initial Incident Commander retains first-hand knowledge at\nthe incident site.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-94\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\n• This strategy allows the initial Incident Commander to observe\nthe progress of the incident and to gain experience.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-95\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 18: Deputy Incident Commander\nDiscussion\nScenario: The Deputy Incident Commander will be replacing the current\nIncident Commander, who needs to attend to a family emergency.\nWhat is the correct action for the Incident Commander?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-96\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 19: Delegating Incident Management\nResponsibilities\nThe Incident Commander only creates those sections that are needed. If a\nsection is not staffed, the Incident Commander will manage those functions.\nThe Incident Commander is responsible for all Incident Command\nSystem (ICS) functional areas until he or she delegates a function.\nSince the ICS organization is modular, it has the ability to expand or\ncontract to meet the needs of the incident.\nNote\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-97\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 20: ICS Command Staff\nDepending upon the size and type of incident\nor event, the Incident Commander may\ndesignate personnel to provide information,\nsafety, and liaison services. In the Incident\nCommand System (ICS), the Command Staff\nmay include:\n• Public Information Officer, who\ninterfaces with the public and media and/or\nwith other agencies with incident-related\ninformation requirements.\n• Safety Officer, who monitors incident\noperations and advises the Incident\nCommander on all matters relating to\nsafety, including the health and safety of\nincident management personnel.\n• Liaison Officer, who serves as the\nIncident Commander’s point of contact for\nrepresentatives of governmental agencies,\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs),\nand private-sector organizations.\nIncident Commanders may also choose to\nappoint technical specialists (such as legal,\nmedical, science and technology, or access\nand functional needs) to act as command\nadvisors.\nThe Command Staff reports directly to the\nIncident Commander. In a complex incident,\nAssistant Officers may be assigned to each of\nthe Command Staff functions.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-98\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 21: Command Staff Overview - Video\nCommand Staff Overview Video\nThe following video will provide an overview of the Command Staff\nOfficers.\nVideo Video Duration: 1 minute, 45 seconds\nCommand Staff Overview\nVideo Transcript\nYou’ve now learned that the Incident Commander has overall authority and\nresponsibility for conducting incident operations. An Incident Commander may assign\nstaff to assist with managing the incident.\nThe Command Staff consists of the Public Information Officer, Safety Officer, and\nLiaison Officer, who all report directly to the Incident Commander.\nLet’s look at the roles of each member of the Command Staff. The Public Information\nOfficer serves as the conduit for information to internal and external stakeholders,\nincluding the media and the public.\nAccurate information is essential. The Public Information Officer serves as the primary\ncontact for anyone who wants information about the incident and the response to it.\nAnother member of the Command Staff is the Safety Officer, who monitors conditions\nand develops measures for assuring the safety of all personnel.\nThe Safety Officer is responsible for advising the Incident Commander on issues\nregarding incident safety, conducting risk analyses, and implementing safety measures.\nThe final member of the Command Staff is the Liaison Officer, who serves as the\nprimary contact for supporting agencies assisting at an incident.\nAdditionally, the Liaison Officer responds to requests from incident personnel for\ncontacts among the assisting and cooperating agencies, and monitors incident\noperations in order to identify any current or potential problems between response\nagencies.\nA Command Staff may not be necessary at every incident, but every incident requires\nthat certain management functions be performed. An effective Command Staff frees the\nIncident Commander to assume a leadership role.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-99\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 22: Command Staff Knowledge Check (1\nof 3)\nWhich member of the Command Staff is described below?\n\"I work very closely with Operations to make sure that our people in the field are\nwearing appropriate protective equipment and implementing safe tactical options.\"\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-100\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 23: Command Staff Knowledge Check (2\nof 3)\nWhich member of the Command Staff is described below?\n\"I provide briefings to supporting Agency Representatives and work with them to\naddress their questions and concerns about the operation.

As a result:\n• Homes, schools, the business district, and the community college\nare being evacuated.\n• Damage to critical infrastructure includes contamination of the\nwater supply, downed power lines, and damaged roads.\n• Perimeter control and security in the business district are needed.\n• Mutual aid is arriving from several surrounding communities.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-103\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\n• Media representatives are arriving at the scene.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-104\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 26: Incident Coordination\nNow that we've discussed the Command Staff roles,\nlet's take a look at how the overall incident is\ncoordinated.\nCoordination involves the activities that ensure the\nonsite Incident Command System (ICS) organization\nreceives the information, resources, and support needed\nto achieve those incident objectives. Coordination takes\nplace in a number of entities and at all levels of\ngovernment. Examples of coordination activities include:\n• Establishing policy based on interactions with\nagency executives, other agencies, and\nstakeholders.\n• Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information\nto support the establishment of shared situational\nawareness.\n• Establishing priorities among incidents.\n• Resolving critical resource issues.\n• Facilitating logistics support and resource tracking.\n• Synchronizing public information messages to\nensure that everyone is speaking with one voice.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-105\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 27: Command and Coordination\nEffective incident management\nconsists of four overarching areas of\nresponsibility:\n1. Direct tactical response to save\nlives, stabilize the incident, and\nprotect property and the\nenvironment\n2. Incident support through resource\nacquisition, information gathering,\nand interagency coordination\n3. Policy guidance and senior level\ndecision making\n4. Outreach and communication with\nthe media and public to keep them\ninformed about the incident\nThese objectives are accomplished\nthrough the use of the Incident\nCommand System (ICS), Emergency\nOperations Centers (EOCs), Multi-\nagency Coordination (MAC) Groups,\nand the Joint Information System\n(JIS), respectively.\nThe Command and Coordination component of NIMS defines these\nstructures and explains how various elements operating at different\nlevels of incident management interface to achieve the maximum\neffect through a shared understanding.\nNote\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-106\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 28: Emergency Operations Center Role\nJurisdictions and organizations across the Nation use\nEmergency Operations Centers (EOCs) as an element\nof their emergency management programs.\nTypically, an Emergency Operations Center (EOC)\nsupports the on-scene response by relieving the\nIncident Commander of the burden of external\ncoordination and the responsibility for securing\nadditional resources.\nAn EOC is:\n• A physical or virtual location where staff from\nmultiple agencies come together to address\nimminent threats and hazards\n• Staffed with personnel trained for, and authorized to,\nrepresent their agency/discipline\n• Equipped with mechanisms for communicating with\nthe incident site\n• Providing support to the incident by obtaining\nresources\n• Applicable at different levels of government\nEOCs may be established at the Federal, state, territorial, tribal, and\nlocal levels.\nIf you are from a non-governmental organization (NGO) or from the\nprivate sector, you may be asked to assist at the EOC to assess a\nNote\nsituation, provide advice, and make recommendations based on your\nknowledge and professional expertise.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-107\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 29: Joint Information Center\nAnother coordination entity is the Joint Information\nCenter (JIC). The JIC:\n• May be established to coordinate all incident-related\npublic information activities\n• Serves as the central point of contact for all news\nmedia-when possible, public information officials\nfrom all participating agencies should co-locate at\nthe JIC\nJICs may be established at various levels of government\nand at incident sites. Depending on your role in the\nincident, you may need to direct individuals or\norganizations to the JIC to obtain information.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-108\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 30: Incident Command or Incident\nCoordination\nDo these statements represent Incident Command or Incident Coordination?\n1.

Section Chiefs have the ability to expand their sections to meet\nthe needs of the situation. As shown here, they report directly to the\nIncident Commander. Let’s take a closer look at these General Staff\nNote\npositions.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-113\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 3: General Staff Overview\nIn an expanding incident, the Incident Commander first establishes the Operations\nSection. The remaining sections are established as needed to support the\noperation.\nThe General Staff overall responsibilities are summarized in the\ngraphic. In an expanding incident, the Incident Command first\nestablishes the Operations Section. The remaining Sections are\nestablished as needed to support the operation.\nNote\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-114\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 4: General Staff Overview Video\nGeneral Staff Overview Video\nThe following video will provide an overview of the General Staff\nSections.\nVideo Video Duration: 2 minutes, 54 seconds\nGeneral Staff Overview\nVideo Transcript\nAs you previously learned, an Incident Commander is responsible for all incident\nmanagement functions including: operations, planning, logistics, and finance and\nadministration.\nDepending on the incident needs, the Incident Commander may delegate some or all of\nthese functions by establishing Sections. If a Section Chief is assigned to an incident,\nhe or she will report directly to the Incident Commander.\nTogether, these Section Chiefs are referred to as the General Staff. Let’s take a look at\nthe responsibilities of each Section Chief.\nThe Operations Section Chief is responsible for developing and implementing strategy\nand tactics to accomplish the incident objectives. This means that the Operations\nSection Chief organizes, assigns, and supervises all the tactical or response resources\nassigned to the incident. Additionally, if a Staging Area is established, the Operations\nSection Chief would manage it.\nThe Planning Section Chief oversees the collection, evaluation, and dissemination of\noperational information related to the incident. It is the Planning Section’s responsibility\nto prepare and disseminate the Incident Action Plan, as well as track the status of all\nincident resources.\nThe Planning Section helps ensure responders have accurate information and provides\nresources such as maps and floor plans.\nThe Logistics Section is responsible for providing facilities, services, and material\nsupport for the incident.\nLogistics is critical on more complex incidents. The Logistics Section Chief assists the\nIncident Commander and Operations Section Chief by providing the resources and\nservices required to support incident activities. During an incident, Logistics is\nresponsible for ensuring the well-being of responders by providing sufficient food, water,\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-115\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nand medical services. Logistics is also responsible for arranging communication\nequipment, computers, transportation, and anything else needed to support the incident.\nAnother critical function during complex incidents is Finance and Administration. The\nFinance and Administration Section Chief is responsible for all of the financial and cost\nanalysis aspects of an incident. These include contract negotiation, recording personnel\nand equipment time, documenting and processing claims for accidents and injuries\noccurring at the incident, and keeping a running tally of the costs associated with the\nincident.\nWe’ve now introduced you to the four ICS Sections.\nIt is important to remember that the ICS organizational structure is determined based\non the incident objectives and resource requirements. It expands and contracts in a\nflexible manner. And, only those functions, positions, or sections necessary for a\nparticular incident are filled.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-116\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 5: Operations Section\nThe Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for an Operations Section and,\nif so, will designate an Operations Section\nChief.\nIt is up to the Operations Section Chief to\nactivate any additional staffing that is needed.\nWhen the Operations Section Chief is\ndesignated, the staging and management of\noperational resources moves from the Incident\nCommand to Operations.\nIf no Operations Section is established, the\nIncident Commander will perform all operations\nfunctions.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-117\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 6: Operations Section Major Activities\nThe major activities of the Operations Section may include:\n• Implementing strategies and developing tactics to carry out the incident\nobjectives\n• Directing the management of all tactical activities on behalf of the Incident\nCommander\n• Supporting the development of the Incident Action Plan to ensure it accurately\nreflects current operations\n• Organizing, assigning, and supervising the tactical response resources\nThe Operations Section is responsible for directing and coordinating\nall incident tactical operations.\nThe Operations Section:\nNote • Is typically one of the first organizations to be assigned to the\nincident.\n• Develops from the bottom up.\n• Has the most incident resources.\n• May have Staging Areas and special organizations.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-118\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 7: Planning Section\nThe Planning Section Chief is designated only\nafter the Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for a Planning Section.\nIt is up to the Planning Section Chief to activate\nany additional staffing that is needed.\nThe Incident Commander will perform all planning\nfunctions if no Planning Section is established.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-119\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 8: Planning Section: Major Activities\nThe major activities of the Planning Section may include:\n• Preparing and documenting Incident Action Plans\n• Managing information and maintaining situational awareness for the incident\n• Tracking resources assigned to the incident\n• Maintaining incident documentation\n• Developing plans for demobilization\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-120\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 9: Logistics Section\nThe Logistics Section Chief is designated only\nafter the Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for a Logistics Section.\nIt is up to the Logistics Section Chief to activate\nany additional staffing that is needed.\nThe Incident Commander will perform all logistics\nfunctions if no Logistics Section is established.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-121\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 10: Logistics Section: Major Activities\nThe Logistics Section is responsible for all services and support needs, including:\n• Ordering, obtaining, maintaining, and accounting for essential personnel,\nequipment, and supplies\n• Providing communication planning and resources\n• Setting up food services for responders\n• Setting up and maintaining incident facilities\n• Providing support transportation\n• Providing medical services to incident personnel\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-122\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 11: Finance/Administration Section\nThe Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for a Finance/Administration\nSection at the incident.\nIf so, the Incident Commander will designate an\nindividual to fill the position of the\nFinance/Administration Section Chief.\nThe Time, Compensation/Claims, Cost, and\nProcurement Units may be established within this\nsection.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-123\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 12: Finance/Administration Section:\nMajor Activities\nThe Finance/Administration Section is set up for any incident that requires incident-\nspecific financial management.

It takes many forms—a hurricane, an\nearthquake, a tornado, a flood, a fire or a hazardous spill, or an act of terrorism. An\nincident can build over days or weeks, or hit suddenly, without warning.\nA poorly managed incident response can undermine our safety and wellbeing. With so\nmuch at stake, we must effectively manage our response efforts.\nAlthough most incidents are handled locally, partnerships among local, tribal, State, and\nFederal agencies as well as nongovernmental and private-sector organizations may be\nrequired.\nAs partners, we must respond together in a seamless, coordinated fashion.\nThe Incident Command System, or ICS, helps ensure incorporation of our response\nefforts. ICS is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazards approach to incident management.\nICS allows all responders to adopt an integrated organizational structure that matches\nthe complexities and demands of the incident while respecting agency and jurisdictional\nauthorities. Although ICS promotes standardization, it is not without needed flexibility.\nFor example, the ICS organizational structure can expand or contract to meet incident\nneeds.\nIn this course, you’ll learn ICS principles. And more importantly, you’ll learn to interface\nbetter with your response partners.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-18"

SARA directed the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA) to establish rules for operations at\nhazardous materials incidents.\n• OSHA rule 1910.120, effective March 6, 1990, requires all\norganizations that handle hazardous materials to use ICS. The\nregulation states: “The Incident Command System shall be\nestablished by those employers for the incidents that will be under\ntheir control and shall interface with other organizations or\nagencies who may respond to such an incident.”\nNote that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires States\nto use ICS at hazardous materials incidents.\nAccording to the National Integration Center, “institutionalizing the use\nof ICS” means that government officials, incident managers, and\nemergency response organizations at all jurisdictional levels must\nadopt ICS. Actions to institutionalize the use of ICS take place at two\nlevels:\n• Policy Level: At the policy level, institutionalizing ICS means\ngovernment officials (i.e., Governors, mayors, county and city\nmanagers, tribal leaders, and others) must:\n• Adopt ICS through executive order, proclamation, or legislation\nas the jurisdiction's official incident response system; and\n• Direct that incident managers and response organizations in\ntheir jurisdictions train, exercise, and use ICS in their response\noperations.\n• Organizational Level: At the organizational/operational level,\nevidence that incident managers and emergency response\norganizations are institutionalizing ICS would include the following:\n• ICS is being integrated into functional and system-wide\nemergency operations policies, plans, and procedures.\n• ICS training is planned or underway for responders,\nsupervisors, and command-level officers.\n• Responders at all levels are participating in and/or coordinating\nICS-oriented exercises that involve responders from multiple\ndisciplines and jurisdictions.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-20"

All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So\nyou can establish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan,\nand you can ensure that they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident.

If a Section Chief is assigned to an incident,\nhe or she will report directly to the Incident Commander.\nTogether, these Section Chiefs are referred to as the General Staff. Let’s take a look at\nthe responsibilities of each Section Chief.\nThe Operations Section Chief is responsible for developing and implementing strategy\nand tactics to accomplish the incident objectives. This means that the Operations\nSection Chief organizes, assigns, and supervises all the tactical or response resources\nassigned to the incident. Additionally, if a Staging Area is established, the Operations\nSection Chief would manage it.\nThe Planning Section Chief oversees the collection, evaluation, and dissemination of\noperational information related to the incident. It is the Planning Section’s responsibility\nto prepare and disseminate the Incident Action Plan, as well as track the status of all\nincident resources.\nThe Planning Section helps ensure responders have accurate information and provides\nresources such as maps and floor plans.\nThe Logistics Section is responsible for providing facilities, services, and material\nsupport for the incident.\nLogistics is critical on more complex incidents. The Logistics Section Chief assists the\nIncident Commander and Operations Section Chief by providing the resources and\nservices required to support incident activities. During an incident, Logistics is\nresponsible for ensuring the well-being of responders by providing sufficient food, water,\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-115"

Logistics is also responsible for arranging communication\nequipment, computers, transportation, and anything else needed to support the incident.\nAnother critical function during complex incidents is Finance and Administration. The\nFinance and Administration Section Chief is responsible for all of the financial and cost\nanalysis aspects of an incident. These include contract negotiation, recording personnel\nand equipment time, documenting and processing claims for accidents and injuries\noccurring at the incident, and keeping a running tally of the costs associated with the\nincident.\nWe’ve now introduced you to the four ICS Sections.\nIt is important to remember that the ICS organizational structure is determined based\non the incident objectives and resource requirements. It expands and contracts in a\nflexible manner. And, only those functions, positions, or sections necessary for a\nparticular incident are filled.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-116"

The\nFederal Government is only one part of the\nwhole community.\nThe Whole Community approach ensures\nsolutions that serve the entire community\nare implemented, while simultaneously\nmaking sure that the resources the different\nmembers of the community bring to the\ntable are used efficiently. These members\ninclude those in all levels of government as\nwell as those in non-governmental and\nprivate-sector organizations in fields such\nas transportation, health care, schools,\npublic works, communications, agriculture,\nchemical/nuclear, and more.\nAs part of the whole community, you will need to understand your role\nin the Incident Command System (ICS) and how ICS works to help\neveryone involved. This course will help in that regard.\nThis course addresses all disciplines that use ICS across the\nNote\ncommunity. In addition, Unit 4 handouts provide discipline-specific\nexamples of ICS applications, such as Public Works, Schools, and\nUtilities. Unit 5 incorporates a variety of disciplines in a series of\nscenarios.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-14\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 12: What is the Incident Command\nSystem?\nThe Incident Command System\n(ICS) is a standardized approach to\nincident management that:\n• Is used for all kinds of incidents\nby all types of organizations and\nat all levels of government; ICS\nis applicable to small incidents\nas well as large and complex\nones.\n• Can be used not only for\nemergencies, but also for\nplanned events.\n• Enables a coordinated response\namong various jurisdictions and\nagencies.\n• Establishes common processes\nfor incident-level planning and\nresource management.\n• Allows for the incorporation of\nresources (such as facilities,\nequipment, personnel) within a\ncommon organizational\nstructure.\nICS - Brief History\nICS was developed in the 1970s following a series of catastrophic\nfires in California. Property damage ran into the millions, and many\npeople died or were injured.\nNote\nThe personnel assigned to study the case histories and determine\nthe causes of these disasters discovered that response problems\ncould rarely be attributed to lack of resources or failure of tactics.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-15\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 13: When is ICS Used?\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) can be\nused to manage any type of incident, including\na planned event (e.g., the Olympics, the\nGovernor's inauguration, state fairs, a local\nparade, etc.). The use of ICS is applicable to all\ntypes of incidents, regardless of their size or\ncause.\nAs a system, ICS is extremely useful. Not only\ndoes it provide an organizational structure for\nincident management, but it also guides the\nprocess for planning, building, and adapting that\nstructure.\nUsing ICS for every incident or planned\nevent provides the practice that will help to\nmaintain and improve skills needed to\neffectively coordinate larger or more\ncomplex efforts.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-16\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 14: ICS for Planned Events\nFrom your own experiences, what are some examples of different types of planned\nevents where ICS was used?\nWhy was it beneficial to use ICS?\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-17\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 15: Incident Command System:\nPromoting Response Partnerships\nIncident Command System: Promoting Response Partnerships\nThe following video will introduce ICS and describe its importance.\nVideo Duration: 1 minute, 30 seconds\nVideo\nIncident Command System: Promoting Response Partnerships\nVideo Transcript:\nDisaster can strike anytime, anywhere. It takes many forms—a hurricane, an\nearthquake, a tornado, a flood, a fire or a hazardous spill, or an act of terrorism. An\nincident can build over days or weeks, or hit suddenly, without warning.\nA poorly managed incident response can undermine our safety and wellbeing. With so\nmuch at stake, we must effectively manage our response efforts.\nAlthough most incidents are handled locally, partnerships among local, tribal, State, and\nFederal agencies as well as nongovernmental and private-sector organizations may be\nrequired.\nAs partners, we must respond together in a seamless, coordinated fashion.\nThe Incident Command System, or ICS, helps ensure incorporation of our response\nefforts. ICS is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazards approach to incident management.\nICS allows all responders to adopt an integrated organizational structure that matches\nthe complexities and demands of the incident while respecting agency and jurisdictional\nauthorities. Although ICS promotes standardization, it is not without needed flexibility.\nFor example, the ICS organizational structure can expand or contract to meet incident\nneeds.\nIn this course, you’ll learn ICS principles. And more importantly, you’ll learn to interface\nbetter with your response partners.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-18\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 16: ICS as a Component of the National\nIncident Management System (NIMS)\nThe National Incident\nManagement System (NIMS) is a\nsystematic, proactive approach to\nguide all levels of government,\nnongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs), and the private sector to\nwork together to prevent, protect\nagainst, mitigate, respond to, and\nrecover from the effects of\nincidents. NIMS provides a\nconsistent foundation for all\nincidents, ranging from daily\noccurrences to incidents requiring\na coordinated Federal response.\nNIMS is organized into three major\ncomponents:\n• Resource Management\n• Command and Coordination\n- including the Incident\nCommand System\n• Communications and\nInformation Management\nIt is important to note that the\nIncident Command System (ICS)\nis just one part of NIMS.\nNational Preparedness and ICS Requirements\nReview the following points about the value of using ICS:\n• ICS works! It saves lives! Life safety is the top priority for ICS\nNote response.\n• The use of ICS is a key indicator of National Incident Management\nSystem (NIMS) implementation. Jurisdictions that receive some\nFederal grants such as National Preparedness Grants must\ndemonstrate NIMS implementation. NIMS provides a systematic,\nproactive approach guiding departments and agencies at all levels\nof government, the private sector, and nongovernmental\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-19\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\norganizations to work seamlessly to prevent, protect against,\nrespond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents,\nregardless of cause, size, location, or complexity, in order to\nreduce the loss of life and property, and harm to the environment.\nIn addition to the NIMS mandate, the following laws require the use of\nICS:\n• The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of\n1986 established Federal regulations for handling hazardous\nmaterials. SARA directed the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA) to establish rules for operations at\nhazardous materials incidents.\n• OSHA rule 1910.120, effective March 6, 1990, requires all\norganizations that handle hazardous materials to use ICS. The\nregulation states: “The Incident Command System shall be\nestablished by those employers for the incidents that will be under\ntheir control and shall interface with other organizations or\nagencies who may respond to such an incident.”\nNote that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires States\nto use ICS at hazardous materials incidents.\nAccording to the National Integration Center, “institutionalizing the use\nof ICS” means that government officials, incident managers, and\nemergency response organizations at all jurisdictional levels must\nadopt ICS. Actions to institutionalize the use of ICS take place at two\nlevels:\n• Policy Level: At the policy level, institutionalizing ICS means\ngovernment officials (i.e., Governors, mayors, county and city\nmanagers, tribal leaders, and others) must:\n• Adopt ICS through executive order, proclamation, or legislation\nas the jurisdiction's official incident response system; and\n• Direct that incident managers and response organizations in\ntheir jurisdictions train, exercise, and use ICS in their response\noperations.\n• Organizational Level: At the organizational/operational level,\nevidence that incident managers and emergency response\norganizations are institutionalizing ICS would include the following:\n• ICS is being integrated into functional and system-wide\nemergency operations policies, plans, and procedures.\n• ICS training is planned or underway for responders,\nsupervisors, and command-level officers.\n• Responders at all levels are participating in and/or coordinating\nICS-oriented exercises that involve responders from multiple\ndisciplines and jurisdictions.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-20\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nNational Preparedness and ICS\nNIMS represents a core set of doctrine, concepts, principles,\nterminology, and organizational processes that enables effective,\nefficient, and collaborative incident management.\nNote\n• Resource Management: Resource Management describes\nstandard mechanisms to systematically manage resources,\nincluding personnel, equipment, supplies, teams, and facilities,\nboth before and during incidents in order to allow organizations to\nmore effectively share resources when needed.\n• Command and Coordination: Command and Coordination\ndescribes leadership roles, processes, and recommended\norganizational structures for incident management at the\noperational and incident support levels and explains how these\nstructures interact to manage incidents effectively and efficiently.\n• Communications and Information Management: Communications\nand Information Management describes systems and methods that\nhelp to ensure that incident personnel and other decision makers\nhave the means and information they need to make and\ncommunicate decisions.\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-21\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 17: Incident Response Problems\nWhat are some common causes of incident response problems?\nLesson 1: Course Welcome and ICS Overview SM-22\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 18: ICS Benefits - Student Activity\nActivity Purpose: The purpose of this activity is to discuss the benefits of ICS.\nInstructions: Follow the steps below to conduct this activity:",

It’s important\nthat we know how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River\nAuthority] If the terms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to\nhave a hard time communicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our\nmission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance\non an Incident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your\nend objective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So\nyou can establish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan,\nand you can ensure that they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established\nunder a single Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-45\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management\nOffice] One of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the\nsame framework.\nICS helps ensure full utilization of all incident resources by:\n• Maintaining a manageable span of control\n• Establishing designated incident facilities and locations\n• Implementing comprehensive resource management practices\n• Defining clear processes for dispatch/ deployment of resources\n• Ensuring integrated communications\nICS supports responders and decision makers through effective information and\nintelligence management.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] The common\noperating picture is a critical thing that the Coast Guard has been working hard on\nrecently for ourselves because it’s something that helps us maintain a better operational\npicture and it’s more consistent across the board, everyone up and down the chain of\ncommand and across to other agencies understand the same picture.\nICS counts on each of us taking personal accountability for our own actions. And\nfinally, the mobilization process helps ensure that incident objectives can be achieved\nwhile responders remain safe.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] To have NIMS\nwork effectively, it’s got to be top-down support.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics covered in this lesson form the basis for\neffective, team-based incident response under the Incident Command System (ICS).\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-46\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 4: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) is based on the following 14 proven NIMS\nmanagement characteristics, each of which contributes to the strength and efficiency of\nthe overall system:\n• Integrated Communications\n• Common Terminology\n• Establishment and Transfer of\n• Modular Organization\nCommand\n• Management by Objectives\n• Unified Command\n• Incident Action Planning\n• Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Manageable Span of Control\nCommand\n• Incident Facilities and Locations\n• Accountability\n• Comprehensive Resource\n• Dispatch/Deployment\nManagement\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-47\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 5: Common Terminology\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) establishes Common\nTerminology that allows different incident management and\nsupport organizations to work together across a wide variety\nof emergency functions and hazard scenarios. This common\nterminology covers the following:\n• Organizational Functions: Major functions and functional\nunits with incident management responsibilities are named\nand defined. They remain standard and consistent.\n• Resource Descriptions: Major resources – including\npersonnel, equipment, teams, and facilities – are given\ncommon names and are “typed” with respect to their\ncapabilities.\n• Incident Facilities: Common terminology is used to\ndesignate the facilities in the vicinity of the incident area.\nDuring an incident:\n• Communications should use common terms.\n• Organizations should avoid radio codes, agency-specific\ncodes, acronyms, or jargon. Usage of these types of codes\nmay cause confusion or possibly compromise life safety\ndue to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation.\nThe goal is to promote understanding among all parties\ninvolved in managing an incident.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-48\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 6: Common Terminology Discussion\nEven if you use codes on a daily basis, why should you use common terminology\nduring an incident response?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-49\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 7: Modular Organization\nThe Incident Command System (ICS)\norganizational structure develops in a\nmodular fashion based on the\nincident’s size and complexity.\n• The responsibility for the\nestablishment and expansion of the\nICS modular organization rests with\nthe Incident Commander.\n• As the incident grows more\ncomplex, the ICS organization may\nexpand as functional responsibilities\nare delegated.\nICS Organizational Structure\nThe ICS organizational structure develops in a top-down, modular\nfashion that is based on the size and complexity of the incident, as\nwell as the specifics of the hazard environment created by the\nNote\nincident. As incident complexity increases, the organization expands\nfrom the top down as functional responsibilities are delegated.\nThe ICS organizational structure is flexible. When needed, separate\nfunctional elements can be established and subdivided to enhance\ninternal organizational management and external coordination. As the\nICS organizational structure expands, the number of management\npositions also expands to adequately address the requirements of the\nincident.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-50\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 8: Management by Objectives\nThe Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand (which will be discussed\nlater), establishes incident objectives\nthat drive incident operations.\nManagement by Objectives includes\nthe following:\n• Establishing specific, measurable\nincident objectives.\n• Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks\nand activities to achieve the\nobjectives.\n• Developing and issuing\nassignments, plans, procedures,\nand protocols to accomplish\nidentified tasks.\n• Documenting results for the incident\nobjectives.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-51\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 9: Incident Action Planning\nIncident action planning guides effective incident\nmanagement activities. An Incident Action Plan (IAP)\nis a concise, coherent means of capturing and\ncommunicating overall incident priorities, objectives,\nstrategies, tactics, and assignments in the context of\nboth operational and support activities. The IAP should\nfocus on addressing the needs of future timeframes\n(called operational periods).\nTo be effective, an IAP should:\n• Cover a specified timeframe\n• Be proactive\n• Specify the incident objectives\n• State the activities to be completed\n• Assign responsibilities\n• Identify needed resources\n• Specify communication protocols\nFor smaller/less complex incidents, the IAP may be\noral or written, except for hazardous materials\nincidents, which require a written IAP. FEMA has\ndeveloped a series of ICS Forms for use in developing\na written IAP.\nIncident Action Plan\nEvery response has a strategy—like a lesson plan—called an Incident\nAction Plan (IAP).\nNote To be effective, an IAP should:\n• Cover a specified timeframe\n• Be proactive\n• Specify the incident objectives\n• State the activities to be completed\n• Assign responsibilities\n• Identify needed resources\n• Specify communication protocols\nEven the smallest of incidents are managed by incident objectives\nand plans. The plan can be as simple as the next steps the Incident\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-52\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nCommander plans to do. The steps can be orally communicated to\nthe rest of the ICS organization.\nIncident Action Plan Questions\nEvery IAP must answer the following four questions:\n• What do we want to do?\nNote • Who is responsible for doing it?\n• How do we communicate with each other?\n• What is the procedure if someone is injured?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-53\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 10: Incident Action Plan - Activity 2.1\nActivity Purpose: To illustrate how to develop an IAP.\nInstructions: Working in groups:",

This ratio is a guideline--incident\npersonnel should use their best\njudgement to determine the appropriate\nratio for an incident.\nIf too much responsibility is given to the supervisor, the span of\ncontrol may become unmanageable. A manageable span of control\non incidents may actually vary depending upon the type of incident,\nnature of the task, hazards and safety factors, and distances between\nNote\npersonnel and resources.\nMaintaining a manageable span of control is particularly important at\nincidents where safety and accountability are a top priority.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-55\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 12: Manageable Span of Control\nDiscussion\nWhat are some examples of when span of control is most critical?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-56\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 13: Incident Facilities and Locations\nDepending upon the incident size and\ncomplexity, various types of support\nfacilities may be established by\nIncident Command. These\ndesignated facilities typically include:\n• Incident Command Post (ICP)\n• Incident base, staging areas, and\ncamps\n• Mass casualty triage areas\n• Point-of-distribution\n• Emergency shelters\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-57\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 14: Comprehensive Resource\nManagement\nComprehensive Resource\nManagement describes standard\nmechanisms to identify\nrequirements, order and acquire,\nmobilize, track and report,\ndemobilize, and reimburse and\nrestock resources such as\npersonnel, teams, facilities,\nequipment and supplies.\nKey resource management activities include:\n• Resource Identification and Typing\n• Qualification, Certification and Credentialing Personnel\nNote • Planning for Resources\n• Acquiring, Storing and Inventorying Resources\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-58\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 15: Comprehensive Resource\nManagement Discussion\nWhy is Comprehensive Resource Management important during an incident?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-59\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 16: Integrated Communications\nIncident communications are facilitated through the development and use of a\ncommon communications plan and interoperable communication processes and\nsystems that include voice and data links.\nIntegrated Communications are necessary to:\n• Maintain connectivity\n• Achieve situational awareness\n• Facilitate information sharing\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-60\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 17: Integrated\nCommunications Discussion\nWhat are some examples of what Integrated Communications may look like?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-61\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 18: Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand\nThe command function should be clearly established\nat the beginning of an incident. The jurisdiction or\norganization with primary responsibility for the\nincident designates the Incident Commander and the\nprocess for transferring command.\nTransfer of command may occur during the course of\nan incident. When command is transferred, the\nprocess should include a briefing that captures all\nessential information for continuing safe and\neffective operations.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-62\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 19: Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand Discussion\nWhat are some reasons that Command might be transferred?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-63\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 20: Unified Command\nIn a Unified Command there is no\nsingle \"Commander.\" Instead the\nUnified Command manages the\nincident through jointly approved\nobjectives. Unified Command allows\nagencies with different legal,\ngeographic, and functional\nresponsibilities to work together\neffectively without affecting individual\nagency authority, responsibility, or\naccountability.\nUnified Command is typically\nestablished when no single\njurisdiction, agency or organization\nhas the authority and/or resources to\nmanage the incident on its own.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-64\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 21: Chain of Command\nChain of command is an orderly line that details how\nauthority flows through the hierarchy of the incident\nmanagement organization. Chain of command:\n• Allows an Incident Commander to direct and\ncontrol the actions of all personnel on the incident.\n• Avoids confusion by requiring that orders flow from\nsupervisors.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-65\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 22: Unity of Command\nWhile chain of command relates to the overall\nhierarchy of the organization, unity of command deals\nwith the fact that all individuals have a single\ndesignated supervisor they report to.\nBased on the principle of unity of command, you will:\n• Report to only one Incident Command System\n(ICS) supervisor.\n• Receive work assignments only from your ICS\nsupervisor.\nWhen you are assigned to an incident, you no longer\nreport directly to your day-to-day supervisor.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-66\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 23: Accountability\nEffective accountability during incident operations is\nessential. As part of the Incident Command System\n(ICS) structure, you will need to abide by agency\npolicies and guidelines and any applicable local, tribal,\nstate, or Federal rules and regulations.\nThere are several principles you will need to adhere to:\n• Check-In/Check-Out. All responders must report in\nto receive an assignment. Checking out is just as\ncritical as checking in.\n• Incident Action Planning. Response operations\nmust be coordinated as outlined in the Incident\nAction Plan.\n• Unity of Command. Each individual will be assigned\nto only one supervisor.\n• Personal Responsibility. ICS relies on each\nindividual taking personal accountability for his or\nher own actions.\n• Span of Control. Supervisors must be able to\nadequately supervise and control their subordinates,\nas well as communicate with and manage all\nresources under their supervision.\n• Resource Tracking. Supervisors must record and\nreport resource status changes as they occur.\nAccountability starts as soon as a resource is\nrequested through the time that the resource returns\nto their home base safely.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-67\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 24: Dispatch/Deployment\nResources should be deployed only when requested or\nwhen dispatched by an appropriate authority through\nestablished resource management systems.\nResources not requested should refrain from self-\ndispatching to avoid overburdening the incident\ncommand.\nDispatch/Deployment\nAnother key feature of ICS is the importance of managing resources\nto adjust to changing conditions.\nNote When an incident occurs, you must be dispatched or deployed to\nbecome part of the incident response. In other words, until you are\ndeployed to the incident organization, you remain in your everyday\nrole.\nAfter being deployed, your first task is to check in and receive an\nassignment.\nAfter check-in, you will locate your incident supervisor and obtain your\ninitial briefing. The briefings you receive and give should include:\n• Current assessment of the situation.\n• Identification of your specific job responsibilities.\n• Identification of coworkers.\n• Location of work area.\n• Identification of break areas, as appropriate.\n• Procedural instructions for obtaining needed resources.\n• Operational periods/work shifts.\n• Required safety procedures and personal protective equipment\n(PPE), as appropriate.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-68\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 25: Dispatch/Deployment - Activity 2.2\nDispatch/Deployment - Activity 2.2\nInstructions: Working individually:\n• Review the scenario and discussion question presented in the\nStudent Manual.\n• Be prepared to share your answer in 5 minutes.\nTime: 10 minutes\nActivity Scenario: Rosa is an off-duty certified Emergency Medical Technician\nwho lives near the scene of a major structural collapse that has\noccurred in a busy shopping center.

In NIMS,\n\"intelligence\" refers exclusively to threat-related\ninformation developed by law enforcement, medical\nsurveillance, and other investigative organizations.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-71\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 28: Information and Intelligence\nManagement Discussion\nWhat are some examples of sources where you can find and gather information and\nintelligence?\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-72\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 29: Unit 2 Summary\nYou have completed the National Incident Management System (NIMS) Management\nCharacteristics unit.\nThis unit introduced:\n• Integrated Communications\n• Common Terminology\n• Establishment and Transfer of\n• Modular Organization\nCommand\n• Management by Objectives\n• Unified Command\n• Incident Action Planning\n• Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Manageable Span of Control\nCommand\n• Incident Facilities and Locations\n• Accountability\n• Comprehensive Resource\n• Dispatch/Deployment\nManagement\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-73\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 30: Unit 2 Summary Continued\nThe next unit will provide an overview of the ICS Functional Areas and introduce the\nroles of the Incident Commander and Command Staff.\nLesson 2: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-74\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and\nCommand Staff Roles\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-75\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 1: Unit 3 Overview\nThis unit introduces you to the Incident Command System (ICS) Functional Areas and\nroles of the Incident Commander and Command Staff. By the end of this unit, you\nshould be able to:\n• Identify the five major ICS functional areas.\n• Describe the role of the Incident Commander.\n• Describe the selection of and transfer of command between Incident Commanders.\n• Identify the position titles associated with the Command Staff.\n• Describe the roles of the Command Staff.\n• Differentiate between incident command and incident coordination.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-76\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 2: ICS Functional Areas and Command\nStaff Roles\nEvery incident requires that certain functional\nareas be implemented. The problem must be\nidentified and assessed, a plan to deal with it\nmust be developed and implemented, and the\nnecessary resources must be procured and\npaid for.\nRegardless of the size of the incident, these\nfunctional areas are all required.\nIn case you ever need to assist with an incident,\nyou should understand how the management\nstructure is constructed using the Incident\nCommand System (ICS). This will help you\nunderstand your role in the structure and how\nyou may receive information and assignments.\nThis unit focuses on the five major functional\nareas and the Command Staff roles. The\nGeneral Staff roles will be discussed in the next\nunit.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-77\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 3: Five Major ICS Functional Areas\nThere are five major Incident Command System\n(ICS) functional areas that are the foundation on\nwhich an incident management organization\ndevelops.\nThese functions apply to incidents of all sizes and\ntypes, including both planned events and ones that\noccur without warning.\nIf you are in an incident and hear these terms, it’s\nimportant for you to know what they mean. For\ninstance, you may be directed to provide\ndocuments to the Planning Section or receipts to\nthe Finance/Administration Section.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-78\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 4: ICS Functional Area Descriptions\nIncident Command: Sets the incident objectives,\nstrategies, and priorities, and has overall\nresponsibility for the incident.\nOperations: Conducts operations to reach the\nincident objectives. Establishes tactics and directs\nall operational resources.\nPlanning: Supports the incident action planning\nprocess by tracking resources, collecting/analyzing\ninformation, and maintaining documentation.\nLogistics: Arranges for resources and needed\nservices to support achievement of the incident\nobjectives (resources can include personnel,\nequipment, teams, supplies, and facilities).\nFinance/Administration: Monitors costs related to\nthe incident. Provides accounting, procurement,\ntime recording, and cost analyses.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-79\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 5: Intelligence/Investigations Function\nin ICS\nIntelligence/Investigations (I/I) is a sixth ICS function identified in\nNIMS. The Intelligence / Investigations function can be established to\ncollect, analyze, and disseminate incident-related information and\nintelligence for incidents involving intensive intelligence gathering and\nNote\ninvestigative activity (such as a criminal or terrorist act, or\nepidemiological, accident or mass fatality investigation).\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-80\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 6: Review of Functional Areas (1 of 5)\nWhich ICS Functional Area supports the incident action planning process by\ntracking resources, collecting/analyzing information, and maintaining\ndocumentation?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-81\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 7: Review of Functional Areas (2 of 5)\nWhich ICS Functional Area sets the incident objectives, strategies, and priorities,\nand has overall responsibility for the incident?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-82\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 8: Review of Functional Areas (3 of 5)\nWhich ICS Functional Area conducts operations to reach the incident objectives,\nestablishes tactics, and directs all operational resources?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-83\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 9: Review of Functional Areas (4 of 5)\nWhich ICS Functional Area monitors costs related to the incident and provides\naccounting, procurement, time recording, and cost analyses?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-84\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 10: Review of Functional Areas (5 of 5)\nWhich ICS Functional Area arranges for resources and needed services to support\nachievement of the incident objectives?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-85\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 11: ICS Structure\nThe standard Incident Command System (ICS) organizational\nstructure is shown here. Incident Command, which could be a single\nIncident Commander or a Unified Command, will lead the effort and,\nNote\nas needed, assign Command Staff and General Staff. For the\nremainder of this unit, we will discuss the Incident Command function\nand the members of the Command Staff.\nICS Organization is Unique\nThe ICS organization is unique but easy to understand. There is no\ncorrelation between the ICS organization and the administrative\nstructure of any single agency or jurisdiction.\nFor example, someone who serves as a director every day would not\nnormally use that title when deployed under an ICS structure. They\nwould use the ICS title of the position that they were assigned to\nwithin the ICS structure.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-86\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nThis is deliberate, because confusion over different position titles and\norganizational structures has been a significant stumbling block to\neffective incident management in the past.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-87\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 12: Incident Command Definition\nThe National Incident Management System\n(NIMS) defines command as the act of\ndirecting, ordering, or controlling by virtue of\nexplicit statutory, regulatory, or delegated\nauthority.\nWhen you are using the Incident Command\nSystem (ICS) to manage an incident, an\nIncident Commander is assigned. The Incident\nCommander has the authority to establish\nobjectives, make assignments, and order\nresources. To achieve these ends, the Incident\nCommander works closely with staff and\ntechnical experts to analyze the situation and\nconsider alternative strategies.\nThe Incident Commander should have the\ntraining, experience, and expertise to serve in\nthis capacity. Qualifications to serve as an\nIncident Commander should not be based\nsolely on rank, grade, or technical knowledge.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-88\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 13: Incident Commander\nLet’s begin by taking a closer look at the Incident Commander. The Incident\nCommander is responsible for the overall management of the incident. Overall\nmanagement includes Command Staff assignments required to support the incident\ncommand function. The Incident Commander is the only position that is always\nstaffed in ICS applications. On small incidents and events, one person-the\nIncident Commander-may accomplish all management functions.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-89\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 14: Incident Commander Discussion\nWhy is it critical to establish command from the beginning of an incident?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-90\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 15: Incident Commander Responsibilities\nIn addition to having the overall responsibility\nfor managing the entire incident, the Incident\nCommander is specifically responsible for:\n• Ensuring overall incident safety\n• Providing information services to internal\nand external stakeholders, such as disaster\nsurvivors, agency executives, and senior\nofficials\n• Establishing and maintaining liaisons with\nother agencies participating in the incident\nThe Incident Commander may appoint one or\nmore Deputies. If a Deputy is assigned, he or\nshe should be fully qualified to assume the\nIncident Commander’s position.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-91\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 16: Selecting or Changing Incident\nCommanders\nThe command function should be clearly\nestablished at the beginning of an incident. The\njurisdiction or organization with primary\nresponsibility for an incident designates the\nindividual at the scene who is responsible for\nestablishing command and the protocol for\ntransferring command. As an incident becomes\nmore or less complex, command may change to\nmeet the needs of the incident.\nWhen command is transferred, the process\nshould include a briefing that captures all\nessential information for continuing safe and\neffective operations.\nReasons for Transfer of Command\nThere are several possible reasons that command might be\ntransferred. Transfer of command may take place when:\nNote • A more qualified Incident Commander arrives and assumes\ncommand.\n• A jurisdiction or agency is legally required to take command. For\nexample, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is legally\nrequired to take the lead for investigations of terrorist incidents.\n• The incident changes in complexity. For example, an incident\nmight start in a small area, but spread into the surrounding\ncommunity, affecting multiple jurisdictions, institutions, or\nagencies.\n• The current Incident Commander needs to rest. On long or\nextended incidents, there is normally turnover of personnel to\naccommodate work/rest requirements.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-92\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 17: Transfer of Command Discussion\nThe transfer of command process always includes a thorough transfer of command\nbriefing, which may be oral, written, or a combination of both.\nIt is also important to remember that the rest of the incident staff should be notified of\nthe transfer of command.\nWhat would you include in a transfer of command briefing?\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-93\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nTransfer of Command Process\nTransfer of Command Process\nThe process of moving the responsibility for incident command from\none Incident Commander to another is called “transfer of command.”\nIt should be recognized that transition of command on an expanding\nNote\nincident is to be expected.

An Incident Commander may assign\nstaff to assist with managing the incident.\nThe Command Staff consists of the Public Information Officer, Safety Officer, and\nLiaison Officer, who all report directly to the Incident Commander.\nLet’s look at the roles of each member of the Command Staff. The Public Information\nOfficer serves as the conduit for information to internal and external stakeholders,\nincluding the media and the public.\nAccurate information is essential. The Public Information Officer serves as the primary\ncontact for anyone who wants information about the incident and the response to it.\nAnother member of the Command Staff is the Safety Officer, who monitors conditions\nand develops measures for assuring the safety of all personnel.\nThe Safety Officer is responsible for advising the Incident Commander on issues\nregarding incident safety, conducting risk analyses, and implementing safety measures.\nThe final member of the Command Staff is the Liaison Officer, who serves as the\nprimary contact for supporting agencies assisting at an incident.\nAdditionally, the Liaison Officer responds to requests from incident personnel for\ncontacts among the assisting and cooperating agencies, and monitors incident\noperations in order to identify any current or potential problems between response\nagencies.\nA Command Staff may not be necessary at every incident, but every incident requires\nthat certain management functions be performed. An effective Command Staff frees the\nIncident Commander to assume a leadership role.\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-99\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 22: Command Staff Knowledge Check (1\nof 3)\nWhich member of the Command Staff is described below?\n\"I work very closely with Operations to make sure that our people in the field are\nwearing appropriate protective equipment and implementing safe tactical options.\"\nLesson 3: ICS Functional Areas and Command Staff Roles SM-100\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nVisual 23: Command Staff Knowledge Check (2\nof 3)\nWhich member of the Command Staff is described below?\n\"I provide briefings to supporting Agency Representatives and work with them to\naddress their questions and concerns about the operation.

If a Section Chief is assigned to an incident,\nhe or she will report directly to the Incident Commander.\nTogether, these Section Chiefs are referred to as the General Staff. Let’s take a look at\nthe responsibilities of each Section Chief.\nThe Operations Section Chief is responsible for developing and implementing strategy\nand tactics to accomplish the incident objectives. This means that the Operations\nSection Chief organizes, assigns, and supervises all the tactical or response resources\nassigned to the incident. Additionally, if a Staging Area is established, the Operations\nSection Chief would manage it.\nThe Planning Section Chief oversees the collection, evaluation, and dissemination of\noperational information related to the incident. It is the Planning Section’s responsibility\nto prepare and disseminate the Incident Action Plan, as well as track the status of all\nincident resources.\nThe Planning Section helps ensure responders have accurate information and provides\nresources such as maps and floor plans.\nThe Logistics Section is responsible for providing facilities, services, and material\nsupport for the incident.\nLogistics is critical on more complex incidents. The Logistics Section Chief assists the\nIncident Commander and Operations Section Chief by providing the resources and\nservices required to support incident activities. During an incident, Logistics is\nresponsible for ensuring the well-being of responders by providing sufficient food, water,\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-115\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nand medical services. Logistics is also responsible for arranging communication\nequipment, computers, transportation, and anything else needed to support the incident.\nAnother critical function during complex incidents is Finance and Administration. The\nFinance and Administration Section Chief is responsible for all of the financial and cost\nanalysis aspects of an incident. These include contract negotiation, recording personnel\nand equipment time, documenting and processing claims for accidents and injuries\noccurring at the incident, and keeping a running tally of the costs associated with the\nincident.\nWe’ve now introduced you to the four ICS Sections.\nIt is important to remember that the ICS organizational structure is determined based\non the incident objectives and resource requirements. It expands and contracts in a\nflexible manner. And, only those functions, positions, or sections necessary for a\nparticular incident are filled.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-116\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 5: Operations Section\nThe Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for an Operations Section and,\nif so, will designate an Operations Section\nChief.\nIt is up to the Operations Section Chief to\nactivate any additional staffing that is needed.\nWhen the Operations Section Chief is\ndesignated, the staging and management of\noperational resources moves from the Incident\nCommand to Operations.\nIf no Operations Section is established, the\nIncident Commander will perform all operations\nfunctions.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-117\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 6: Operations Section Major Activities\nThe major activities of the Operations Section may include:\n• Implementing strategies and developing tactics to carry out the incident\nobjectives\n• Directing the management of all tactical activities on behalf of the Incident\nCommander\n• Supporting the development of the Incident Action Plan to ensure it accurately\nreflects current operations\n• Organizing, assigning, and supervising the tactical response resources\nThe Operations Section is responsible for directing and coordinating\nall incident tactical operations.\nThe Operations Section:\nNote • Is typically one of the first organizations to be assigned to the\nincident.\n• Develops from the bottom up.\n• Has the most incident resources.\n• May have Staging Areas and special organizations.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-118\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 7: Planning Section\nThe Planning Section Chief is designated only\nafter the Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for a Planning Section.\nIt is up to the Planning Section Chief to activate\nany additional staffing that is needed.\nThe Incident Commander will perform all planning\nfunctions if no Planning Section is established.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-119\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 8: Planning Section: Major Activities\nThe major activities of the Planning Section may include:\n• Preparing and documenting Incident Action Plans\n• Managing information and maintaining situational awareness for the incident\n• Tracking resources assigned to the incident\n• Maintaining incident documentation\n• Developing plans for demobilization\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-120\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 9: Logistics Section\nThe Logistics Section Chief is designated only\nafter the Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for a Logistics Section.\nIt is up to the Logistics Section Chief to activate\nany additional staffing that is needed.\nThe Incident Commander will perform all logistics\nfunctions if no Logistics Section is established.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-121\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 10: Logistics Section: Major Activities\nThe Logistics Section is responsible for all services and support needs, including:\n• Ordering, obtaining, maintaining, and accounting for essential personnel,\nequipment, and supplies\n• Providing communication planning and resources\n• Setting up food services for responders\n• Setting up and maintaining incident facilities\n• Providing support transportation\n• Providing medical services to incident personnel\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-122\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 11: Finance/Administration Section\nThe Incident Commander determines whether\nthere is a need for a Finance/Administration\nSection at the incident.\nIf so, the Incident Commander will designate an\nindividual to fill the position of the\nFinance/Administration Section Chief.\nThe Time, Compensation/Claims, Cost, and\nProcurement Units may be established within this\nsection.\nLesson 4: General Staff Roles SM-123\n\n\nMarch 2025 IS-0100.c: An Introduction to the Incident Command System, ICS 100\nMarch 2025\nVisual 12: Finance/Administration Section:\nMajor Activities\nThe Finance/Administration Section is set up for any incident that requires incident-\nspecific financial management.
