The Incident Objectives (ICS 202) describes the basic incident strategy, incident objectives, command\nemphasis/priorities, and safety considerations for use during the next operational period.\nPreparation. The ICS 202 is completed by the Planning Section following each Command and General Staff meeting\nconducted to prepare the Incident Action Plan (IAP). In case of a Unified Command, one Incident Commander (IC) may\napprove the ICS 202. If additional IC signatures are used, attach a blank page.\nDistribution. The ICS 202 may be reproduced with the IAP and may be part of the IAP and given to all supervisory\npersonnel at the Section, Branch, Division/Group, and Unit levels. All completed original forms must be given to the\nDocumentation Unit.\nNotes:\n• The ICS 202 is part of the IAP and can be used as the opening or cover page.\n• If additional pages are needed, use a blank ICS 202 and repaginate as needed.\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n1 Incident Name Enter the name assigned to the incident.

Ideally, these objectives will be listed in priority order.\nThese objectives are for the incident response for this operational\nperiod as well as for the duration of the incident. Include alternative\nand/or specific tactical objectives as applicable.\nObjectives should follow the SMART model or a similar approach:\nSpecific – Is the wording precise and unambiguous?\nMeasurable – How will achievements be measured?\nAction-oriented – Is an action verb used to describe expected\naccomplishments?\nRealistic – Is the outcome achievable with given available resources?\nTime-sensitive – What is the timeframe?\n4 Operational Period Command Enter command emphasis for the operational period, which may\nEmphasis include tactical priorities or a general weather forecast for the\noperational period. It may be a sequence of events or order of events\nto address. This is not a narrative on the objectives, but a discussion\nabout where to place emphasis if there are needs to prioritize based\non the Incident Commander’s or Unified Command’s direction.\nExamples: Be aware of falling debris, secondary explosions, etc.\nGeneral Situational Awareness General situational awareness may include a weather forecast,\nincident conditions, and/or a general safety message.
