Utilities also utilize the construct of mutual assistance allowing them to “loan”\nand “borrow” resources (human and material) between companies/agencies to promptly effect energy\nrestoration activities using these or like frameworks. Taking an All Hazards approach to routine, daily\nbusiness is the norm these days for utility companies and being more compatible with their first\nresponse partners when there is a “blue sky” emergency in the field on any given day has demonstrated\nthe benefit of the Incident Command System for utilities. Utilities are now able to “scale” ICS from a\n“blue sky” day to a complex or long duration incident because the concepts are used more frequently.\nThe majority of utilities in the U.S. are privately held corporations but also include municipal operations,\nspecial districts, and other government bodies. It is important that ICS for Utilities address all of these\nenvironments and configurations and that the tenets integrate between the public and private sectors.\nHow might the ICS Command Structure Look in a Utilities\nEnvironment?\nEach utility is taking the foundational concepts of ICS and tailoring the system for their operations.\nSome utilities are using ICS for weather only related incidents and others are using it across their\n1\n\n\ncompany/agency for incidents beyond weather such as: Generation Plant outages, Wildfires involving\nfacilities or lines; Data Center outages; Call Center outages; etc. When properly designed ICS will\nprovide an integration strategy that includes all business units of the company/agency whether in a\nsingle corporate/agency environment or across multiple companies/agencies and multiple states or\ndisciplines. Utilities are unique in terms of configuration – Electric and Gas; Electric and Water; Gas\nOnly; and also include other energy provides like Fuel.\nThe most important implementation component is to remain true to the basic ICS structure (see\ndiagram above) and build out from there. That way the company/agency will remain aligned with other\nutilities who may provide support during mutual assistance activations.\nThe system allows the utility to expand and contract the structure to manage span of control; to ensure\nappropriate resources are available and properly allocated; and that the entire company/agency\nremains on the same “operational” page during the response and recovery.\nCOMMAND STAFF\nIncident Commander\nThe Incident Commander for a utility is likely a person who is broadly familiar with corporate/agency\noperations – whether in the Emergency Operations Center or at the scene in the Field at an Incident\nCommand Post. Many utilities (private sector) have elevated their Executives to a Policy Team level\n(rather than leading Operations as an Incident Commander) so that they are available for policy level\ndecisions and to interact with Government leaders during a large scale emergency. Therefore, the\nExecutives have delegated authority for Incident Command to a high level staff member who is capable\nof managing the emergency response and recovery operations.\nThe Incident Commander is responsible for establishing incident objectives and activating other\ncomponents of the Incident Management Team (IMT).\n2\n\n\nMany utilities are requiring their Incident Commanders to take additional levels of ICS training (I100,\n200, 700, 300/400 and the IC “L” course) to strengthen their capacity and capabilities for serving in this\nrole. Additional information on these courses is located here https://training.fema.gov/.\nPublic Information Officer (PIO)\nMost, if not all utilities have a Public Relations department or business unit that is working daily on both\ninternal and external communications with employees, customers, stakeholders and shareholders alike.\nTheir transition into the Public Information Office (PIO) role is typically seamless during an emergency\nand in many instances they may be the first party contacted from the utility by the news media when\nsomething happens.\nThe most important task beyond their normal duties is to learn more about the Joint Information Center\n(JIC) and Joint Information System (JIS) environments to ensure the utility’s messaging is well aligned\nwith those of its counterparts in other agencies/parts of the community. Additional information on PIO\nspecific courses are located here https://training.fema.gov/.\nSafety Officer (SO)\nLike the PIO, most utilities have daily operational Safety Officers that are working across the utility\nenvironment to ensure worker and operational safety (internally and externally). Utilities work in a\nroutinely dangerous environment and it is important that the Safety Officer is familiar with “blue sky” as\nwell as emergency hazards that may escalate during non-routine operations. Most utilities have\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that include their safety tailboards and rules of engagement. The\nmost important thing a utility can do is gather their Safety Team and walk through and\ndiscuss/document how conditions change during specific emergencies – fire; flood; earthquake;\ntornado; pipeline rupture; dig-in; etc. This will allow the utility to expand their traditional safety SOPs\nfor any situation they may face. Then through routine drills and exercises, the responders and Safety\nOfficers can work together to ensure the refined, emergency SOPs will protect both employees and the\npublic during a response/recovery effort.\nLiaison Officer (LO)\nThe Liaison Officer also exists in a variety of formats in many utility environments – whether based in an\nemergency management/business continuity, facility, customer focused or in a government affairs role.\nThese utility staffers are consistently interacting and supporting the utility’s mission and objectives on a\ndaily basis with their counterparts in other organizations.\nThe most important component of the LO in a utility is broadening the reach and brokering additional\nrelationships with their counterparts and ensuring there is unity from the utility to the outside world.\nThere are multiple internal/external relationships for differing purposes and the utility should work to\nensure alignment within the company/agency and who is communicating with who and for what\npurpose.\n3\n\n\nGENERAL STAFF\nThe General Staff consists of up to four sections: Operations, Planning, Logistics and Finance/\nAdministration. In an expanding incident the Incident Commander first establishes the Operations\nSection. The remaining sections are established as needed to support the operation.\nOperations Section Chief (OSC)\nThe Operation Section is responsible for directing ALL tactical operational aspects of the incident. The\nkey within a utility is to ensure specific Operations Section Chiefs exist with subject matter expertise for\nthe incident/situation at hand. Because the utility environment has a great deal of diversity, it is\nimportant that each OSC has the knowledge, training and capabilities to manage the resources, logistical\nneeds and safety of the incident. This can differ greatly -- as an example - a weather related incident\ninvolving multiple power outages vs. a fire at a generation plant.\nMany utilities are requiring their OSCs to take additional levels of ICS training (I100, 200, 700, 300/400\nand the OSC “L” course) to strengthen their capacity and capabilities for serving in this role. Additional\ninformation on these courses is located here https://training.fema.gov/.\nPlanning Section Chief (PSC)\nThe Planning Section is a pivotal role in many utilities as they are typically involved with dispatch in\nactivating the emergency response system, the Incident Management Team (IMT) and/or opening the\nEmergency Operations/Coordination Center (EOC/ECC). The Planning Section Chief works with the\nIncident Commander in support of the Field operations to facilitate the Planning “P” cycle which\nincludes - collects, evaluates and displays incident information, prepares and documents incident action\nplans, tracks resources assigned to the incident, maintains incident documentation and develops plans\nfor demobilization.\nThe PSC collects and provides situational awareness which is tantamount to meeting incident objectives\nand maintaining safety.\nLogistics Section Chief (LSC)\nThe Logistics Section is responsible for ensuring that there are adequate resources including personnel,\nsupplies and equipment and are typically employed in the Supply Chain business unity of the utility.\n4\n\n\nThey are usually familiar with contractors, contracts, purchasing and shipping/delivery methodologies\nand in some cases involved in the request for mutual assistance assets.\nOne of the important elements for the LSC is to begin tracking resources with the PSC at incident onset.\nThis will assist the Finance Section with costs and claims later or after the incident.\nFinance/Administration Section Chief (FSC)\nThe Finance/ Administration function manages paying for the incident or event response. This includes\nall aspects of financial and cost analysis: contract negotiation, tracking personnel and equipment time,\ndocumenting and processing claims for accidents and injuries occurring at the incident and keeping a\nrunning tally of costs associated with the incident. The Finance/ Administration Section works closely\nwith Logistics to contract for and procure the resources needed to manage the incident.\nThere are differences between the public and private sector utility in that the public sector utility\nmay be eligible for FEMA reimbursement following a declared emergency while a private sector\nutility will likely be dependent on insurance.\nApplication of Incident Command in Utilities\nAs the saying goes, if you have met one utility – you have met one utility. Applying ICS would depend on\nthe type of utility: Electric, Gas, Water, Fuel, etc.\nICS would apply to many of these areas:\n• Corporate/Agency IMT\n• ICS in the Field including Unified Command\n• Transmission & Distribution (Electric, Gas, Water, Fuel)\n• Generation (Plant, Pipeline, Petroleum Refinery)\n• IT/Data Center\n• Call Center\nConclusion\nFor additional Information:\n• FEMA ICS Resource Center, https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/\n• Additional ICS Training, https://training.fema.gov/\n5",
