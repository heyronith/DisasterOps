The Incident Organization Chart (ICS 207) provides a visual wall chart depicting the ICS organization position\nassignments for the incident. The ICS 207 is used to indicate what ICS organizational elements are currently activated\nand the names of personnel staffing each element. An actual organization will be event-specific. The size of the\norganization is dependent on the specifics and magnitude of the incident and is scalable and flexible. Personnel\nresponsible for managing organizational positions are listed in each box as appropriate.\nPreparation. The ICS 207 is prepared by the Resources Unit Leader and reviewed by the Incident Commander.\nComplete only the blocks where positions have been activated, and add additional blocks as needed, especially for\nAgency Representatives and all Operations Section organizational elements. For detailed information about positions,\nconsult the NIMS ICS Field Operations Guide. The ICS 207 is intended to be used as a wall-size chart and printed on a\nplotter for better visibility. A chart is completed for each operational period, and updated when organizational changes\noccur.\nDistribution. The ICS 207 is intended to be wall mounted at Incident Command Posts and other incident locations as\nneeded, and is not intended to be part of the Incident Action Plan (IAP). All completed original forms must be given to the\nDocumentation Unit.\nNotes:\n• The ICS 207 is intended to be wall mounted (printed on a plotter). Document size can be modified based on individual\nneeds.\n• Also available as 8½ x 14 (legal size) chart.\n• ICS allows for organizational flexibility, so the Intelligence/Investigative Function can be embedded in several different\nplaces within the organizational structure.\n• Use additional pages if more than three branches are activated. Additional pages can be added based on individual\nneed (such as to distinguish more Division/Groups and Branches as they are activated).\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n1 Incident Name Print the name assigned to the incident.\n2 Operational Period Enter the start date (month/day/year) and time (using the\n• Date and Time From 24-hour clock) and end date and time for the operational\nperiod to which the form applies.\n• Date and Time To\n3 Organization Chart • Complete the incident organization chart.\n• For all individuals, use at least the first initial and last\nname.\n• List agency where it is appropriate, such as for Unified\nCommanders.\n• If there is a shift change during the specified operational\nperiod, list both names, separated by a slash.\n4 Prepared by Enter the name, ICS position, and signature of the person\n• Name preparing the form.
