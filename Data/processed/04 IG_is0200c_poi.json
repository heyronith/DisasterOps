This course is designed for online delivery as Independent Study (IS) and\nalso for delivery in the classroom as Instructor-Led Training (ILT). Information\npresentation, discussion, and multiple application activities have been designed to\nenable students to learn, practice, and demonstrate their knowledge. Both versions of\nBasic Incident Response System for Initial Response, ICS 200 have been designed to\ninclude:\n• Content Presentation: Content to address the course objectives.\n• Resources: Additional resource links to provide students with additional course\nrelated content for their examination.\n• Expandable Content: Topics expand to include application to different disciplines for\nresponse partners.\n• Knowledge Checks: Multiple choice and scenario questions are used throughout the\ncourse to allow students to get feedback on their retention and recall of the content.\n• Videos: Videos provide overviews of select topic areas.\nICS Training and NIMS The National Incident Management\nSystem (NIMS) National Standard\nCurriculum: Training Development\nGuidance outlines the system’s ICS\nconcepts and principles, management\ncharacteristics, organizations and\noperations, organizational element titles,\nand recommendations for a model\ncurriculum. It also provides an evaluation\nchecklist for content that may be used to\nmake sure that the training meets the “as\ntaught by DHS” standard. The guidance\ndocument is available for download from\nthe NIMS homepage at\nhttps://www.fema.gov/national-incident-\nmanagement-system\nThe model NIMS ICS curriculum\norganizes four levels of training: IS-100.c\nAn Introduction to the Incident Command\nSystem, ICS 100; IS-200.c Basic Incident\nCommand System for Initial Response,\nICS 200; E/L/G 0300 Intermediate Incident\nPlan Of Instruction 8\n\n\nMarch 2019 POI - IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nCommand System for Expanding\nIncidents, ICS-300; and E/L/G 0400,\nAdvanced Incident Command System for\nComplex Incidents. ICS training provided\nby the Emergency Management Institute\n(EMI), the National Fire Academy (NFA),\nthe National Wildfire Coordinating Group\n(NWCG), the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture (USDA), the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA), and the U.S.\nCoast Guard (USCG) follows this model.\nAccording to the National Integration\nCenter, emergency management and\nresponse personnel already ICS trained do\nnot need retraining if their previous training\nis consistent with the DHS standard. This\nwould include ICS courses managed,\nadministered, or delivered by EMI, NFA,\nNWCG, USDA, EPA, or USCG. For more\ninformation about NIMS ICS, email the\nNational Integration Center at FEMA-\nNIMS@dhs.gov, or call 202-646-3850.\nCourse Materials Listed below are the materials that you will\nneed in order to conduct this course:\n Instructor Guide: Obtain one copy of\nthe Instructor Guide for each trainer.\n Student Manual: Secure one copy of\nthe Student Manual for each person\nattending the session.\n PowerPoint Files: The course visuals\nmay be downloaded from the EMI\nwebsite. Transfer the course visuals\nto the hard drive of a computer. The\nvisuals will operate more effectively if\nthey are accessed directly from the\ncomputer’s hard drive.\n Course Evaluation Forms: Make sure\nthat you have one copy of the course\nevaluation form for each person\nPlan Of Instruction 9\n\n\nMarch 2019 POI - IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nattending the training.\nCourse Equipment The following equipment is required for\nconducting this course:\n Computer and Projection Device:\nMake arrangements to have a\ncomputer with a PowerPoint slide\nprojector.

Visuals are\nused to present the common ICS leadership responsibilities and leadership values such\nas duty, respect, and integrity.\nPlan Of Instruction 13\n\n\nMarch 2019 POI - IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNext, the unit presents communication responsibilities and required briefing elements.\nFollowing a definition of incident management assessment, students identify the types\nof questions that they would ask to assess the effectiveness of incident management.\nThe next section covers the use of common terminology and the ICS organization. A\nseries of questions is used to review the Command and General Staff positions and\nsections. Next the lesson emphasizes the importance of manageable span of control as\nan ICS leadership tool and notes that ICS modular organization concepts ensure that an\noptimal manageable span of control is maintained. The last topic covers the standard\ntitles used for ICS supervisory positions.\nFor the flexible delivery version of the course, there are there activities included. The\npurpose of Activity 2.1 is for the students to practice recognizing potential incident\nmanagement issues. They are given a scenario and asked to identify potential\nmanagement issues. The purpose of Activity 2.2 is to allow students to practice\nidentifying communication strategies to avoid problems during incident\noperations. Students are provided a scenario and will list strategies on chart paper and\nreport out to the group. Activity 2.3 is designed to stimulate thought and discussion\nabout desirable leadership qualities. Students must identify important leadership\nqualities and how they relate to incident response.\nKnowledge checks are strategically embedded throughout the lessons in the online\nversion of the course so students may assess their level of retained and recalled\nlearning of the instructional content.\nTIME PLAN\nA suggested time plan for this unit is shown below.
