The NRF is built on scalable, flexible, and adaptable\nconcepts identified in the National Incident Management System (NIMS) to align key roles and\nresponsibilities across the Nation. The structures, roles, and responsibilities described in this\nFramework can be partially or fully implemented in the context of a threat or hazard, in anticipation of\na significant event, or in response to an incident. Implementation of the structures and procedures\ndescribed herein allows for a scaled response, delivery of specific resources and capabilities, and a\nlevel of coordination appropriate to each incident.\nResponding to disasters and emergencies requires the cooperation of a variety of organizations; the\nlarger or more complex the incident, the greater the number and variety of organizations that must\nrespond. Think of a residential fire: Firefighters are leading the charge; public works may be on scene\nproviding traffic control; police are providing security; emergency medical services personnel are\ntriaging, transporting, and redistributing injured to local hospitals; and a local nonprofit or voluntary\norganization (e.g., American Red Cross and Salvation Army) may be on hand to assist displaced\nresidents. For large disasters, such as major hurricanes or earthquakes, the incident complexity is\nincreased as others—such as states or tribes and, ultimately, the Federal Government—become\ninvolved. Businesses, voluntary organizations, and other elements of the private sector are also key\nstakeholders, providing the essential services that must be restored following an incident. The NRF\nprovides the foundation for how these organizations coordinate, integrate, and unify their response.\nThe unprecedented scale of recent disasters has spurred continued innovation in response operations\nand highlighted the need for further progress to build resilient capabilities to respond to disasters of\nincreasing frequency and magnitude. This fourth edition of the NRF embraces lessons-learned from\nthose disasters and shares emerging best practices.\nSince publication of the third edition of the NRF in 2016, disaster response operations have\nunderscored the paramount importance of sustaining essential community lifelines. The Framework\ndefines community lifelines as those services that enable the continuous operation of critical\ngovernment and business functions and are essential to human health and safety or economic security.\nIf disrupted, rapid stabilization of community lifelines is essential to restoring a sense of normalcy.\nRecent disasters have illuminated two underlying features of community lifelines that highlight\nopportunities to strengthen response planning and operations.\nFirst, community lifelines are interdependent and vulnerable to cascading failures. For example,\ncommunications and electric power systems rely on each other to function; severe damage to one will\ndisrupt the other. Most lifelines also rely on complex supply chains. Water and wastewater service\ndepend on the resupply of a broad array of chemicals and—if power goes out—fuel for emergency\ngenerators. However, in a severe natural or human-caused incident, those supply chains themselves\nmay be broken.\nSecond, community lifeline stabilization relies on businesses and infrastructure owners and operators\nwho have the expertise and primary responsibility for managing their systems in emergencies.\nAccordingly, new doctrine and coordination mechanisms are needed to enable the private sector to\nplay a larger, more comprehensive role in preparedness and response activities.\nThe NRF is structured to help jurisdictions, citizens, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and\nbusinesses develop whole community plans, integrate continuity plans, and build capabilities to\nrespond to cascading failures among businesses, supply chains, and infrastructure sectors, as well as\ncollaborate with the private sector and NGOs to stabilize community lifelines and enable restoration\nii\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nof services in severe incidents. Critical infrastructure sector leadership (sector-specific agencies,\ngovernment coordinating councils, and sector coordinating councils) create an established network to\ncollaborate with their respective private sector partners and support cross-sector1 response operations.\nOften, Emergency Support Functions (ESF) work with sector leadership to bolster preparedness for\ncross-sector collaboration. This fourth edition of the NRF describes new initiatives that leverage\nexisting networks and better integrate business interests and infrastructure owners and operators into\nthe heart of emergency management.\nThe NRF describes ways to improve coordination and response structures to build preparedness for\ncatastrophic incidents. Stabilizing community lifelines in catastrophic incidents is vital and\nextraordinarily difficult. Communities cannot meet these challenges solely by scaling up existing plans\nand capabilities. Rather, new mechanisms are needed to supplement and integrate those already in\nplace and facilitate cross-sector coordination, while respecting the roles of private sector partners and\nauthorities of agencies at all levels of government.\nA new ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure is introduced to focus on engaging private\nsector interests and infrastructure owners and operators—particularly those in sectors not currently\naligned to other ESFs—and conducting cross-sector analysis to help inform decision making. ESF #14\nrelies on other ESFs aligned with a critical infrastructure sector to continue coordination with their\ncorresponding sector during response efforts. ESF #14 helps coordinate multi-sector response\noperations between (or across) the government and private sector for natural or human-caused\ncatastrophic incidents that jeopardize national public health and safety, the economy, and national\nsecurity.\nThis edition of the Framework also builds on the response approach in previous editions to address\nnational security emergencies. The National Security Strategy of the United States of America notes\nthat potential adversaries are developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten U.S.\ncritical infrastructure.2 Adversaries may also strategically target attacks to exploit interdependencies\nbetween infrastructure sectors and magnify cascading failures between them, posing incident response\nchallenges above and beyond those created by earthquakes or other catastrophic natural hazards. The\ninitiatives in this Framework address the resulting challenges for consequence management in ways\nthat supplement and support other government, private sector, and NGO plans and coordinating\nstructures.\n1 Cross-sector operations are those actions taken by public and private sector organizations from one or more of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors to help entities or facilities associated with other sectors respond to an incident, being\nfocused on preventing or mitigating cascading failures between sectors and restoring critical supply chains.\n2 For more information on the National Security Strategy of the United States of America, see\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf.\niii\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................... 1\nEvolution of the Framework ...................................................................................................1\nFramework Purpose and Organization .................................................................................2\nScope..........................................................................................................................................3\nIntended Audience ...................................................................................................................5\nGuiding Principles ...................................................................................................................5\nFoundational Components ........................................................................................... 8\nPrioritized Stabilization of Community Lifelines .................................................................8\nNational Incident Management System ...............................................................................11\nCore Capabilities ....................................................................................................................12\nOperational Coordination ........................................................................................... 15\nPrivate Sector Engagement ...................................................................................................15\nLocally Executed Response ...................................................................................................16\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Managed Response ......................................18\nFederally Supported Response .............................................................................................19\nRoles and Responsibilities for Response ................................................................. 25\nCommunities ...........................................................................................................................26\nLocal Government .................................................................................................................29\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Government ..................................................30\nFederal Government ..............................................................................................................34\nFederal Authorities ...................................................................................................... 42\nFederal Response and Assistance Under the Robert T.

The National\nResponse Framework (NRF) sets the strategy and doctrine for how the whole community builds,\nsustains, and delivers the response core capabilities identified in the National Preparedness Goal in an\nintegrated manner with the other mission areas. The fourth edition of the NRF emphasizes enhancing\nthe unity of effort between the government and the private sector through better coordination and\ncollaboration.\nEvolution of the Framework\nThe NRF builds on over 25 years of federal response guidance, beginning with the Federal Response\nPlan, published in 1992, and the National Response Plan, published in 2004. This fourth edition of the\nNRF reorganizes and streamlines the previous version of the NRF, expands principles and\nconcepts to better integrate government and private sector response efforts, and introduces the\ncommunity lifelines concept and terminology.\nThis document supersedes the National Response Framework, Third Edition that was\nissued in June 2016 and becomes effective 60 days after publication.\nCommunity lifelines are those services that enable the continuous operation of critical government and\nbusiness functions and are essential to human health and safety or economic security. In serious but\npurely local incidents, interruptions of water service, electric power, and other community lifeline\ncomponents are typically brief and easy to mitigate. However, severe and widespread incidents can\nhalt lifeline services for many weeks or months. Such disruptions are especially extensive in\ncatastrophic incidents and may result in mass casualties and other cascading consequences.\nMaking community lifelines a core focus of incident response within the NRF offers unique benefits\nfor incidents ranging from small-scale to catastrophic disasters. By building capabilities to stabilize4\nand accelerate the restoration of community lifeline services, it will be possible to save countless lives,\nlimit damage to the economy, help maintain essential services for critical national security installations,\nreduce the initial impacts of disasters, and facilitate recovery operations. While the primary focus of\nincident response remains on stabilizing community lifelines, other secondary considerations regarding\nthe natural and cultural environment and economic factors are equally as important.\n3 Whole community includes individuals and communities, businesses, private and public sector owners and operators\nof critical infrastructure, faith-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, and all levels of government (local,\nregional/metropolitan, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal). Whole community is defined in the National\nPreparedness Goal as “a focus on enabling the participation in national preparedness activities of a wider range of\nplayers from the private sector, including nongovernmental organizations and the general public, in conjunction with\nthe participation of all levels of governmental in order to foster better coordination and working relationships.”\n4 Stabilization occurs when immediate threats to life and property are anticipated, resourced, and managed and basic\ncommunity lifeline services are provided to survivors.\n1\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nCommunity lifelines provide a valuable decision-making construct to integrate cross-sector5 response\noperations and reporting. Each lifeline depends on multiple infrastructure sectors, businesses, and\nsupply chains to function. Focusing on community lifelines allows emergency managers and their\npartners to account for these complex interdependencies and prioritize response operations to achieve\nhigh-impact, multi-sector benefits. The Framework describes how the resources and capabilities of the\nFederal Government support such operations, while the new Emergency Support Function (ESF) #14\n– Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex describes how it facilitates coordination and\ncollaboration with business and infrastructure owners and operators to provide assistance and integrate\nthe private sector's support during response, particularly for those sectors not currently aligned to other\nESFs. Additional detail on the community lifelines can be found in the Prioritized Stabilization of\nCommunity Lifelines section.\nFinally, the Framework’s focus on community lifelines necessitates deeper collaboration with the\nprivate sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGO). During the disasters of 2017 and 2018,\nindividual businesses and infrastructure owners and operators (including public and private sectors)\nforged innovative, collaborative relationships with government agencies to help prioritize and\naccelerate the stabilization of community lifeline services. The fourth edition of the NRF and ESF #14\n– Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex institutionalize their progress and build upon it in\nways that respect the authorities, responsibilities, and roles of all public, private, and NGO partners\nessential to incident response.\nFramework Purpose and Organization\nThe NRF is a guide to how the Nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies. The NRF is\nbuilt on scalable, flexible, and adaptable concepts identified in the National Incident Management\nSystem (NIMS) to align key roles and responsibilities across the Nation. The NRF describes specific\nauthorities and best practices for managing incidents that range from the serious but purely local to\nthose that are catastrophic and national in scope.\nWithin the NRF, the term “response” includes actions to save lives, protect property and the\nenvironment, stabilize the incident, and meet basic human needs following an incident. Response also\nincludes the execution of emergency plans and actions to enable recovery. The NRF describes doctrine\nfor managing all types of disasters or emergencies, regardless of scale, scope, and complexity. The\ngoals and objectives herein explain common response disciplines and processes that have been\ndeveloped at all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area,6 and federal) and have\nmatured over time.\nTo achieve the National Preparedness Goal, the objectives of the NRF are to do the following:\n Describe coordinating structures, as well as key roles and responsibilities for integrating\ncapabilities across the whole community, to support the efforts of governments, the private sector,\nand NGOs in responding to actual and potential incidents;\n Describe how unity of effort among public and private sectors, as well as NGOs, supports the\nstabilization of community lifelines and prioritized restoration of infrastructure during an incident\n5 Cross-sector operations are those actions taken by public and private sector organizations from one or more of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors to help entities or facilities associated with other sectors respond to an incident,\nfocused on preventing or mitigating cascading failures between sectors and restoring critical supply chains. These\noperations include measures taken by infrastructure owners and operators, businesses, and their government partners\nto account for cross-sector interdependencies in incident response operations.\n6 Per the Stafford Act, insular areas include Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Other statutes or departments and agencies may define the term “insular area” differently.\n2\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nand enables recovery, including the elements that support economic security, such as restoration\nof business operations and other commercial activities;\n Describe the steps needed to prepare for delivering the response core capabilities, including\ncapabilities brought through businesses and infrastructure owners and operators in an incident;\n Foster integration and coordination of activities for response actions; and\n Provide guidance through doctrine and establish the foundation for continued improvement of the\nResponse Federal Interagency Operational Plan (FIOP), its incident annexes, as well as\ndepartment and agency plans that implement the FIOP.\nThe NRF also advances progress under the National Security Strategy of the United States of America.\nThe Framework helps achieve the strategy’s first pillar: to “protect the American people, the homeland,\nand the American way of life.” To accomplish this goal, the strategy calls for initiatives to strengthen\nthe Nation’s ability to withstand and recover rapidly from attacks and natural disasters. The NRF is\nstructured to help achieve these goals by establishing a new federal ESF coordinating structure to help\nmitigate the impact of catastrophic incidents on community lifelines and account for the risk that\nadversaries will seek to complicate and disrupt U.S. response operations.\nThe NRF is composed of a base document, ESF annexes, and support annexes. The annexes provide\ndetailed information to assist with the implementation of the NRF.\n ESF annexes describe the federal coordinating structures that group resources and capabilities into\nfunctional areas most frequently needed in a national response.\n Support annexes describe other mechanisms by which support is organized among private sector,\nNGO, and federal partners. The support annexes describe the essential supporting processes and\nconsiderations common to most incidents. Content found within the support annexes is superseded\nby changes and updates to legislation. The support annexes include the following:\n− Financial management\n− International coordination\n− Public affairs\n− Tribal relations\n− Volunteer and donations management\n− Worker safety and health\nThe Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Support Annex and Private Sector Coordination Support\nAnnex, which supplemented previous versions of the NRF, have been superseded in this fourth edition\nof the NRF by ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex, which has been added as\npart of this updated framework. All references to these support annexes within the ESF or support\nannexes should be read as referring to the ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure.\nScope\nThe NRF is a framework for all types of threats and hazards, ranging from accidents, technological\nhazards, natural disasters, and human-caused incidents. This Framework is utilized to implement\nNIMS and describes whole community coordinating structures and response activities; in particular,\nthe Framework outlines government, private sector, and nongovernmental roles to reinforce\n3\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ncollaborative incident response.7 The NRF also describes the structure and mechanisms for national-\nlevel policy and operational direction for incident management to ensure timely and effective federal\nsupport to local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governmental activities and survivors. The\nNRF is applicable to all federal, local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area departments and agencies\nthat participate in operations requiring a coordinated federal response.\nNRF elements can be implemented at any time for any hazard, including the employment of ESF\nmechanisms. The structures, roles, and responsibilities described herein can be partially or fully\nimplemented in the context of a threat or hazard, in anticipation of a significant event, or in response\nto an incident. Implementation of NRF structures and procedures allows for a scaled response, delivery\nof the specific resources and capabilities, and a level of coordination appropriate to each incident.\nThe response mission area includes the capabilities necessary to stabilize an incident, save lives, protect\nproperty and the environment, meet basic human needs, restore community lifeline services and other\nbasic community functionality, and establish a safe and secure environment to facilitate the integration\nof recovery activities.\nIn this fourth edition of the NRF, the thresholds for catastrophic incident response may vary depending\non one’s perspective. A localized flood can be catastrophic to an individual family who lost their home\nand possessions, a severe tornado can be catastrophic to a town or city, and a hurricane can be\ncatastrophic to a state or territory. At the national level, a catastrophic incident8 is one of such extreme\nand remarkable severity or magnitude that the Nation’s collective capability to manage all response\nrequirements would be overwhelmed, thereby posing potential threats to national security, national\neconomic security, and/or the public health and safety of the Nation. A national catastrophic incident\nimplies that the necessary resources are not available within expected timeframes for incident response.\nDuring a national catastrophic incident, decision makers would be forced to consider the landscape of\nrequirements and prioritize resources to manage shortfalls rather than to address all needs at once. Such\na situation would also require the extraordinary means of mobilizing and prioritizing national resources\nto alleviate human suffering; protect lives and property; reduce damage to natural, cultural, and historic\nresources; stabilize the Nation’s economy; and ensure national security.\nIn this Framework, the term “incident” includes any occurrence, natural or manmade, that necessitates\na response to protect life or property and includes planned events, as well as emergencies or disasters\nof all kinds and sizes. The NRF’s structures and procedures address how federal departments and\nagencies coordinate support for local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments and how\ngovernment at all levels works in unity with private sector and NGOs.\nNothing in the NRF is intended to alter or impede the ability of a local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea government or Federal Government department or agency to carry out its authorities or meet its\nresponsibilities under applicable laws, Executive orders, and directives.\n7 The NRF must be consistent with all pertinent statutes and policies, particularly those involving privacy and civil\nand human rights, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Civil\nRights Act of 1964.\n8 The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 defines the term “catastrophic incident” as “any\nnatural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage\nor disruption severely affecting the population (including mass evacuations), infrastructure, environment, economy,\nnational morale, or government functions in an area.”\n4\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nIntended Audience\nThe NRF is intended to be used by communities; the private sector; NGOs; local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, and insular area governments; and the Federal Government, as well as other entities involved\nin response. The private sector includes for-profit and nonprofit organizations, formal and informal\nstructures, commerce, and industries that comprise the national economy and are not part of a\ngovernment structure. NGOs are a distinct category of organizations within the private sector that can\ninclude voluntary, ethnic, faith-based, veteran-based, disability,9 relief agency, and animal welfare\norganizations, among others, and are referenced separately. This all-inclusive whole community\napproach focuses efforts and enables a full range of stakeholders to participate in national preparedness\nactivities and to be full partners in incident response, including emergency management practitioners,\nfirst responders, and community leaders.\nInfrastructure owners and operators (in private and public sectors), and other elements of the private\nsector, are especially important partners for incident response and a key audience for the Framework.\nThese partners are vital for strengthening the coordination between industry and government that is\nnecessary to stabilize community lifelines after major incidents or events. They are also crucial partners\nfor creating the plans and doctrine to support essential functions for cross-sector response operations,\nespecially where their ability to volunteer capabilities and expertise provides vital (and in some cases\nirreplaceable) contributions to protecting public health and safety. Moreover, because catastrophic\nincidents will create far more requests for emergency resources and types of government assistance\nthan can be immediately fulfilled, infrastructure owners and operators and other commercial interests\ncan help government agencies establish objective, nationwide criteria to help inform the allocation of\nscarce resources to promote stabilization efforts, restore infrastructure, and to reduce morbidity and\nmortality.\nThe fourth edition of the NRF describes how the whole community contributes to and benefits from\nnational preparedness and integrated incident response. This includes children;10 older adults;\nindividuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs;11 those from religious, racial,\nand ethnically diverse backgrounds; people with limited English proficiency; and owners of animals,\nincluding household pets and service and assistance animals. Their individual contributions and needs\nmust be incorporated into response planning and delivery of the core capabilities. For further\ninformation, see the Core Capabilities section.\nGuiding Principles\nThe following principles establish fundamental doctrine for the response mission area to support\nlocally executed, state managed, and federally supported disaster operations: (1) engaged partnership;\n(2) tiered response; (3) scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities; (4) unity of effort\n9 An individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities (an\n“actual disability”) or a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity (“record\nof”) or an actual or perceived impairment, whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life\nactivity that is not both transitory and minor (“regarded as”). Individuals with disabilities have civil rights protections\nthat may not be waived under any circumstances, including throughout emergencies and disasters.\n10 Children require a unique set of considerations across the core capabilities contained within this document. Their\nneeds must be taken into consideration as part of any integrated planning effort.\n11 Access and functional needs refer to persons who may have additional needs before, during, and after an incident\nin functional areas, including but not limited to maintaining health, independence, communication, transportation,\nsupport, services, self-determination, and medical care. Individuals in need of additional response assistance may\ninclude those who have disabilities, live in institutionalized settings, are older adults, are children, are from diverse\ncultures, have limited English proficiency or are non-English speaking, or are transportation disadvantaged.\n5\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nthrough unified command; and (5) readiness to act. These principles are rooted in the federal system\nand the U.S. Constitution’s division of responsibilities between federal and state governments. These\nprinciples reflect the history of emergency management and the distilled wisdom of responders and\nleaders across the whole community.\nEngaged Partnership\nLocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments understand their needs best and play a\ncritical role in involving the whole community in preparing for and responding to disasters in order to\nmanage risk to communities and infrastructure.\nThose who lead emergency response efforts must communicate and support engagement with the\nwhole community by developing shared goals and aligning capabilities to reduce the scope and\nduration of impacts to any jurisdiction in times of crisis. Layered, mutually supporting capabilities of\nindividuals, communities, the private sector, NGOs, and governments at all levels allow for\ncoordinated planning in times of calm and effective response in times of crisis. Engaged partnership\nand coalition building include ongoing clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically\nappropriate communication to ensure an appropriate response. 12\nPartnership engagement entails continuous adaptation and improvements for incident preparedness and\ncontinuity of operations against all types of threats and hazards. The spectrum of viable threats is\nexpanding. Most notably, cyber threats to the Nation’s critical infrastructure and the community\nlifelines are intensifying. New challenges for incident response are also emerging. For example, in\nconjunction with cyberattacks, adversaries may spread false disaster reporting via social media and\nother means in order to incite panic and disrupt response operations. Thus, continuous engagement\nestablishing regular and clear communication between response partners is essential to ensuring that\naccurate, accessible, and actionable information and situational awareness is made available in\nresponse to these and other emerging threats.\nTiered Response\nMost incidents begin and end locally and are managed and executed at the local or tribal level. Incidents\nrequire a unified response from local agencies, the private sector, tribes, and NGOs. Some may require\nadditional support from neighboring jurisdictions or state governments. A smaller number of incidents\nrequire federal support.13 Incidents that occur within or along the borders of federally managed lands\nand state, tribal, and territorial lands require unity of effort among federal, state, tribal, or territorial\ngovernments at the local level. National response processes are structured to provide tiered levels of\nsupport when additional resources or capabilities are needed.\n12 Information, warnings, and communications associated with emergency management must ensure effective\ncommunication, such as through the use of appropriate auxiliary aids and services (e.g., interpreters, captioning, and\nalternative format documents) for individuals with disabilities and provide meaningful access to limited English-\nproficient individuals. Accessible messaging should be employed for individuals who use assistive technology and\nemploy non-technological means to reach those who do not have access to communication technology and those living\nin remote areas.\n13 Certain incidents such as a pandemic or cyberattack may not be limited to a specific geographic area and may be\nmanaged at the local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, or federal level, depending on the nature of the incident.\n6\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nWhen all levels of government become engaged, a response is federally supported, state managed, and\nlocally executed, with tribes, territories, and insular area governments often managing the response, as\nwell. The Federal Government’s support and response during disasters build on and are affected by the\ncapacity of state, tribal, territorial, insular, and local governments, as well as the business community\nand NGOs. Preparedness efforts with partners at all levels increase the effectiveness of tiered response.\nScalable, Flexible, and Adaptable Operational Capabilities\nAs incidents change in size, scope, and complexity, response efforts must adapt to meet evolving\nrequirements. The number, type, and sources of resources must be able to expand rapidly to meet the\nchanging needs associated with a given incident and its cascading effects. As needs grow and change,\nresponse processes must remain nimble, adaptable, and resilient. The structures and processes\ndescribed in the NRF must be able to apply resources from the whole community to support disaster\nsurvivors and stabilize the community. As incidents stabilize, response efforts must be flexible to\nfacilitate the integration of recovery activities.\nUnity of Effort Through Unified Command\nThe NIMS concept of unified command14 maximizes response efforts while integrating and respecting\nthe roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of all participating organizations. The Incident Command\nSystem (ICS), as prescribed by NIMS, is important to ensuring interoperability across\nmultijurisdictional or multiagency incident management activities. Unified command enables unity of\neffort when no single jurisdiction, agency, or organization has primary authority and/or the resources\nto manage an incident on its own. The use of unified command enables jurisdictions and those with\nauthority or responsibility for the incident to jointly manage and direct incident activities through\nestablishment of common incident objectives, strategies, and a single incident action plan. ICS is used\nby all levels of government, as well as by many NGOs and private sector organizations.\nReadiness To Act\nFrom individuals and communities to businesses, nonprofit, faith-based, and voluntary organizations\nand all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal), national response\ndepends on the ability to act decisively. A forward-leaning posture is imperative for incidents that may\nexpand rapidly in size, scope, or complexity, as well as incidents that occur without warning. Decisive\naction is often required to save lives and protect property and the environment. Although some risk to\nresponders may be unavoidable, all response personnel are responsible for anticipating and managing\nrisk through proper planning, organizing, equipping, training, and exercising.\n14 The ICS “unified command” concept is distinct from the military use of this term. Concepts of “command” and\n“unity of command” have distinct legal and cultural meanings for military forces and military operations. Military\nforces always remain under the control of the military chain of command and are subject to redirection or recall at any\ntime. Military forces do not operate under the command of the incident commander or under the unified command\nstructure, but they do coordinate with response partners and work toward a unity of effort while maintaining their\ninternal chain of command.\n7\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nPrior to and during catastrophic incidents or a national security emergency15, especially those that\noccur with little or no notice, the Federal Government may mobilize and deploy assets in anticipation\nof a formal request from the state, tribe, territory, insular area, or under existing federal response\nauthorities. Proactive efforts are intended to ensure that federal resources reach the scene in time to assist\nin reducing disruption of normal functions of local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments\nand are done in coordination and collaboration with the governments, private sector entities, and NGOs,\nwhen possible.\nFoundational Components\nPrioritized Stabilization of Community Lifelines\nStabilizing community lifelines is the primary effort during response to lessen threats and hazards to\npublic health and safety, the economy, and security. A community lifeline enables the continuous\noperation of critical government and business functions and is essential to human health and safety or\neconomic security. Together, the community lifelines reframe incident information to provide decision\nmakers with root cause and impact analysis. This construct maximizes the effectiveness of federally\nsupported, state managed, and locally executed response. Figure 1 identifies the seven community\nlifelines: Safety and Security; Food, Water, Shelter; Health and Medical; Energy (Power & Fuel);\nCommunications; Transportation; and Hazardous Material.\nFigure 1: Community Lifelines for Incident Stabilization\nThe seven community lifelines represent only the most basic services a community relies on and which,\nwhen stable, enable all other activity within a community. The lifelines are designed to enable\nemergency managers, infrastructure owners and operators, and other partners to analyze the root cause\nof an incident impact and then prioritize and deploy resources to effectively stabilize the lifeline. As\nexplained later in the NRF, ESFs deliver core capabilities to stabilize community lifelines for an\neffective response. Similar to the ESFs, other whole community organizations can work together to\nstabilize lifelines and meet disaster needs. The community lifelines do not directly cover all important\naspects of community life that can be affected by an incident, including impacts to natural, historical,\nand cultural resources. For example, financial and economic issues important to the life and safety of\naffected individuals may also arise indirectly from impacts to lifelines during an incident.\n15 National security emergency means any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological\nemergency, or other emergency, that seriously degrades or threatens the national security of the United States, as\ndefined in Executive Order 12656.\n8\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nExample of Impacts on Financial Services After a Community Lifeline Disruption\nA tornado has caused massive devastation in a rural town. Among the major impacts to\ncommunity lifelines is the community’s inability to access money.\n Power outages have kept several bank branches closed and automated teller\nmachines (ATM) inoperable, and merchants who are open despite the power outages\nare only able to accept cash transactions.\n Some merchants, ATMs, and bank branches are already open and have been\nenergized through grid or generator power. However, communications outages\nprevent them from accessing systems to process an electronic transaction.\n Transportation issues (road closures and blockages) limit survivors’ ability to travel to\nthe limited merchants, ATM locations, and bank branches in the area, as well as\nresponders’ ability to provide assets to stabilize critical infrastructure.\nThese cumulative effects, while incredibly disruptive to the community, are caused by a\nconfluence of impacts to specific lifelines. By using the community lifeline construct and\nroot cause analysis, emergency managers can assess that the major limiting factors\nrestricting community access to money are through the power, transportation, and\ncommunications lifelines. Accordingly, a local emergency manager may alleviate the\nsituation by considering options, such as prioritized route clearance for emergency access\nby power and communications crews, generators for temporary power, or deployment of\nmobile cell towers, for establishing connectivity until other infrastructure is restored.\nThe community lifelines are composed of multiple components that encompass infrastructure, assets,\nand services. Table 1 provides a brief description of each community lifeline but is not a comprehensive\nlist of all components that should be analyzed.\nTable 1: Community Lifeline Descriptions\nCommunity Lifeline Description\n• Law enforcement and government services, as well as the associated\nassets that maintain communal security, provide search and rescue,\nSafety and Security\nevacuations, and firefighting capabilities, and promote responder\nsafety.\n• Support systems that enable the sustainment of life, such as water\ntreatment, transmission, and distribution systems; food retail and\nFood, Water, Shelter\ndistribution networks; wastewater collection and treatment systems; as\nwell as sheltering, and agriculture.\n• Infrastructure and service providers for medical care, public health,\nHealth and Medical patient movement, fatality management, behavioral health, veterinary\nsupport, and health or medical supply chains.\n• Service providers for electric power infrastructure, composed of\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution systems, as well as gas and\nEnergy liquid fuel processing, transportation, and delivery systems. Disruptions\ncan have a limiting effect on the functionality of other community\nlifelines.\n• Infrastructure owners and operators of broadband Internet, cellular\nCommunications\nnetworks, landline telephony, cable services (to include undersea\n9\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nCommunity Lifeline Description\ncable), satellite communications services, and broadcast networks\n(radio and television). Communication systems encompass a large set\nof diverse modes of delivery and technologies, often intertwined but\nlargely operating independently. Services include elements such as\nalerts, warnings, and messages, as well as 911 and dispatch. Also\nincludes accessibility of financial services.\n• Multiple modes of transportation that often serve complementary\nfunctions and create redundancy, adding to the inherent resilience in\nTransportation overall transportation networks. Transportation infrastructure generally\nincludes highway/roadways, mass transit, railway, aviation, maritime,\npipeline, and intermodal systems.\n• Systems that mitigate threats to public health/welfare and the\nenvironment. This includes assessment of facilities that use, generate,\nHazardous Material and store hazardous substances, as well as specialized conveyance\nassets and efforts to identify, contain, and remove incident debris,\npollution, contaminants, oil or other hazardous substances.\nAs described in Table 1, community lifelines rely on multiple government entities, businesses, and\ninfrastructure sectors to function. As a result, response operations to stabilize a lifeline are unlikely to\nfit within a single department, agency, ESF, infrastructure sector, or industry. Moreover, because these\nsectors and the community lifelines they support are interdependent, failures in one will cascade across\nto others.\nAccounting for these interdependencies and their associated requirements for cross-sector assistance\nthey entail poses overarching challenges in building preparedness for complex incidents. The\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the sector-specific agencies, has\nidentified National Critical Functions16 that enable the Federal Government, in partnership with\ninfrastructure owners and operators, to improve the risk management process before and after an\nincident and can support community lifeline assessments and stabilization efforts.\nCommunity lifelines can be used by all levels of government, the private sector, and other partners to\nfacilitate operational coordination and drive outcome-based response. Figure 2 shows how community\nlifelines are applied to support decision-making.\nFigure 2: The Application of Community Lifelines to Support Emergency Management\n16 National Critical Functions are the functions of government and the private sector so vital to the United States that\ntheir disruption, corruption, or dysfunction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security,\nnational public health or safety, or any combination thereof.\n10\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nAfter an incident, initial assessments of the community lifelines (i.e., whether they are impacted and\nto what extent) help establish incident priorities and objectives that drive response actions.\nContinuously reassessing the status of community lifelines enables decision-makers to adjust\noperations in ways that can accelerate incident stabilization.\nUsing the community lifelines enables emergency managers and decision makers at all levels (e.g.,\nbusiness and infrastructure owners and operators, economic development agencies, comptrollers,\npublic health officials, and healthcare providers) to understand and assess impacts on a community,\nidentify limiting factors, and quickly develop solutions following an incident. Decision makers must\nrapidly determine the scope, complexity, and interdependent impacts of a disaster, so applying the\ncommunity lifeline construct will allow them to do the following:\n Prioritize, sequence, and focus response efforts toward maintaining or restoring the most critical\nservices and infrastructure;\n Utilize a common lexicon to facilitate communication across various stakeholders;\n Promote a response that facilitates unity of effort among the whole community (e.g., Federal\nGovernment; state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and local governments; and private sector and\nnongovernmental entities); and\n Clarify which components of the disaster are complex (emergent) and/or complicated (difficult),\nrequiring cross-sector coordination.\nResponse activities organized around the community lifelines allow local, state, tribal, territorial,\ninsular, and Federal Government emergency managers, along with private sector and nongovernmental\npartners, to better align, sequence, and prioritize limited public and private sector resources. The intent\nis to efficiently stabilize the incident by anticipating, resourcing, and managing immediate threats to\nlife and property and to set the conditions for longer-term infrastructure restoration and economic and\ncommunity recovery. Community lifeline stabilization is not the end state in itself for incident response\nand recovery, but a construct to achieve efficacy and efficiency throughout the disaster response phase.\nNational Incident Management System\nThe purpose of NIMS is to provide a common approach to managing incidents. NIMS concepts provide\nfor standardized but flexible incident management and support practices that emphasize common\nprinciples, a consistent approach for operational structures and supporting mechanisms, and an\nintegrated approach to resource management. The response protocols and structures described in the\nNRF align with NIMS. NIMS provides the template for the management of incidents, regardless of\nsize, scope, cause, or complexity, while the NRF provides the structure and mechanisms for policy\nimplementation and incident response. Standardizing national response doctrine on NIMS integrates\nthe capabilities and resources of various governmental jurisdictions, incident management and\nemergency response disciplines, NGOs, and the private sector into a cohesive, coordinated, and\nseamless national framework for incident response.\nAll of the components of NIMS—resource management, command and coordination, and\ncommunications and information management—support response. The NIMS concept of unified\ncommand is described in the command and coordination component of NIMS. This concept is essential\nto effective response operations because it addresses the importance of (1) developing a single set of\nobjectives; (2) using a collective, strategic approach; (3) improving information flow and coordination;\n(4) creating a common understanding of joint priorities and limitations; (5) ensuring that no agency’s\nlegal authorities are compromised or neglected; and (6) optimizing the combined efforts of all\nparticipants under a single plan.\n11\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nMutual Aid\nCommunities apply NIMS principles to integrate response plans and resources across jurisdictions,\ndepartments, the private sector, and NGOs. Various public and private mutual aid systems can be\nleveraged. Neighboring communities or organizations play a key role by providing support through a\nnetwork of mutual aid and assistance agreements that identify the resources that communities may\nshare during an incident. Additionally, private sector organizations often establish mutual aid\nagreements with each other to increase capabilities and expedite their response.\nThe ability to provide mutual aid accurately and rapidly is critical during disasters, but mutual aid\npartners require a common language and process to support the sharing of qualified personnel. The\nNational Qualification System (NQS) addresses this challenge by providing a common language and\napproach for qualifying, certifying, and credentialing incident management and support personnel.\nNQS provides the tools for jurisdictions and organizations to share resources seamlessly. Using the\nNQS approach helps to ensure personnel deploying through mutual aid agreements and compacts have\nthe required capabilities to perform their assigned duties.17\nCore Capabilities\nEach mission area—prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery—identifies core\ncapabilities required to address common threats and hazards. Using the core capabilities construct\nenables communities and organizations to focus on specific preparedness measures necessary to ensure\nthat the capabilities are available when needed. By allowing communities and organizations to quantify\nresponse requirements and measure response capacity, core capabilities are the key performance\nmanagement tool in emergency preparedness.18\nThe National Preparedness Goal describes the core capabilities necessary to be prepared for all threats\nand hazards. The core capabilities provide a common vocabulary describing the significant functions\nthat must be maintained and executed across the whole community to achieve the goal of a “secure\nand resilient nation.”\nPrevention: Avoiding, preventing, or stopping a threatened or actual act of terrorism.\nWithin the context of national preparedness, the term “prevention” refers to dealing with\nimminent threats.\nProtection: Securing the homeland against acts of terrorism and human-caused or natural\ndisasters.\nMitigation: Reducing loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.\nResponse: Saving lives, stabilizing community lifelines, protecting property and the\nenvironment, and meeting basic human needs after an incident has occurred.\nRecovery: Assisting impacted communities with restoration and revitalization.\nThe response core capabilities are the activities that generally must be accomplished in incident\nresponse, regardless of which levels of government are involved. While core capabilities are organized\nby mission area, they do not operate exclusively within that mission area. Actions related to one core\ncapability often can inform actions associated with another.\n17 For more information on NQS, see https://www.fema.gov/national-qualification-system; for more information on\nNQS typing tools, see https://rtlt.preptoolkit.fema.gov/Public/Combined.\n18 For a full list of the core capabilities, see https://www.fema.gov/core-capabilities.\n12\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nCommunity Lifeline Stabilization and the Core Capabilities\nCore capabilities are used to organize, analyze, and build the functions and services needed in response.\nThe core capabilities developed during the preparedness cycle are applied throughout response to\nstabilize community lifelines and enable recovery.\nBy engaging the whole community to build and deliver the response core capabilities, the Nation is\nbetter prepared to respond to a threat or hazard; to assist in restoring basic services, community\nfunctionality, and economic activity; and to facilitate the integration of recovery activities. Table 2\nshows how response core capabilities may relate to the community lifelines.\nTable 2: Examples of a Steady-State Relationship Between Community Lifelines and Response\nCore Capabilities\nCommunity Lifeline* Related Response Core Capabilities**\n• On-scene Security, Protection, and Law Enforcement\n• Fire Management and Suppression\n• Mass Search and Rescue Operations\nSafety and Security\n• Public Health, Healthcare, and Emergency Medical\nServices\n• Environmental Response/Health and Safety\n13\nInfrastructure\nSystems\nSituational\nAssessment\nOperational\nCoordination\nPublic\nInformation\nand\nWarning\nPlanning\n• Mass Care Services\nFood, Water, Shelter • Logistics and Supply Chain Management\n• Public Health, Healthcare, and Emergency Medical\nServices\n• Fatality Management Services\nHealth and Medical\n• Environmental Response/Health and Safety\n• Logistics and Supply Chain Management\n• Mass Care Services\nEnergy (Power & • Logistics and Supply Chain Management\nFuel)\n• Operational Communications\nCommunications\n• Public Information and Warning\nTransportation • Critical Transportation\nHazardous Material • Environmental Response/Health and Safety\n* Community Lifelines: How emergency managers assess and prioritize employment of capabilities for\nstabilization.\n** Core Capabilities: An interoperable means to characterize capabilities that may be assessed, built, or validated\nduring preparedness or applied to response operations.\nIntegration Among Mission Areas\nPotential points of intersection between the response mission area and other mission areas include the\nfollowing:\nPrevention. Response organizations coordinate with those responsible for preventing imminent acts\nof terrorism or an attack (e.g., a significant cyber incident causing cascading and/or physical impacts)\nto understand both potential and specific threats and to prepare accordingly by creating plans for\ngeneral threats and crisis action plans for credible threats.\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n When an incident may have been caused by an intentional act, response organizations coordinate\nclosely with law enforcement agencies to attribute the cause and prevent additional follow-on\ninstances.\n Response agencies coordinate with law enforcement agencies to enable themselves to prepare,\ntrain, stage, and plan for the delivery of consequence management capabilities.\n Response agencies must coordinate with the owners of properties impacted by a particular incident\nwho have the first responsibility for prevention, protection, and response.\nProtection. Protection of critical infrastructure systems and implementation of plans for the rapid\nrestoration of commercial activities and critical infrastructure operations are crucial aspects of the\nprotection mission area. Many of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors19 within the protection mission\narea are also represented in the response mission area. The existing infrastructure plans and\ncoordination mechanisms (e.g., sector-specific agencies and councils) provide strong foundations for\nstrengthening incident response plans and capabilities. As part of the National Infrastructure Protection\nPlan, public and private sector partners in each of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors and agencies at\nall levels of government have developed and maintain sector-specific plans that focus on the unique\noperating conditions and risk landscape within that sector.\n Response agencies should utilize the sector coordination constructs (e.g., sector-specific agencies\nor sector coordinating councils) to elicit advice and recommendations regarding systemic\nvulnerabilities, cross-sector interdependencies, and sector-level challenges that could hinder\nrestoration.\n Impacts to infrastructure may result in the need for consequence management (e.g., cyberattacks).\nMitigation. Effective mitigation efforts directly limit the impact of an emergency, disaster, or attack\non community lifelines and systems, thereby reducing the required scale of response capabilities\nneeded for an incident. The National Mitigation Investment Strategy recommends actions for all\nnational stakeholders involved in disaster resilience to reduce risks to and impacts on lifelines,\nbuildings, infrastructure, ecosystems, and cultural, historic, and natural resources. Planning, response,\nand regulatory organizations coordinate to reduce risks to critical infrastructure by evaluating potential\nthreats, encouraging resiliency in infrastructure, and planning for redundancy in services. These\norganizations often have information and the data about hazards and risks that can be shared with\nresponse personnel to improve response planning and execution.\n Response operations should leverage those organizations with relevant risk management equities\nto ascertain threats and hazards, understand vulnerabilities, and predict lifeline and survivor\nimpacts or needs to enable more expedient response operations.\n Opportunities to lessen the risks of future hazards are an important element to building national\nresilience.\nRecovery. As response activities are underway, recovery operations must begin. Applying the\ncommunity lifelines construct enables response officials to more effectively identify the requirements\nand sequence steps in the recovery process, including activities that support the economy, by focusing\nthem on vital areas of community support. This includes providing essential public health and safety\nservices; restoring interrupted utility and other essential services; reestablishing transportation routes\nand other infrastructure (e.g., agriculture), providing food, water, and shelter for those displaced by an\nincident; protecting natural and cultural resources and ensuring environmental compliance; ensuring\n19 The critical infrastructure sectors are described in the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan,\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/national-infrastructure-protection-plan-2013-508.pdf.\n14\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nequal access to services in accordance with applicable laws; reunifying children, adults, and household\npets who have been separated from their families/guardians; and reopening schools and child care\ncenters.\n Response organizations are responsible for setting the conditions that foster a quick and seamless\nintegration of recovery operations and establish conditions that enable a community’s recovery.\n Effective recovery support also depends on successful information sharing between the ESFs and\nthe six Recovery Support Functions (RSF) under the National Disaster Recovery Framework\n(NDRF).\n Recovery programs—including sheltering and housing, volunteer organization coordination,\ndonations management, small business and agriculture assistance or loans, as well as other disaster\nassistance—often support response and recovery objectives.\nThese overlapping areas are identified through comprehensive planning with the whole community to\nensure they are properly addressed during the response to an incident. Ensuring that operational plans\nproperly account for the integration of all mission areas is essential.\nOperational Coordination\nIncident management begins and ends locally, and most incidents are managed or executed at the\nclosest possible geographical, organizational, and jurisdictional levels. Successful incident\nmanagement often depends on the cooperation of multiple jurisdictions, levels of government,\nfunctional agencies, NGOs and emergency responder disciplines, and the private sector, which requires\neffective coordination across a broad spectrum of activities and organizations. Accordingly, the\noptimal disaster response follows the model of being locally executed; state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea managed; and federally supported with private sector and NGO engagement throughout.\nOperational coordination occurs across all of these levels and consists of actions and activities that\nenable decision makers to determine appropriate courses of action and provide oversight for all types\nof incidents, including complex homeland security operations, to achieve unity of effort and effective\noutcomes.\nPrivate Sector Engagement\nPublic sector government resources alone cannot provide all the solutions when responding to\nincidents. Acting within regulatory and authoritative guidelines, government entities and the private\nsector can provide mutually beneficial incident-specific response support. When government, private\nsector, and NGO resources are mutually supportive and aligned, there is a much better chance of\nmeeting communities’ incident and economic recovery needs. All elements of the community should\nbe activated, engaged, and integrated to respond to a major or catastrophic incident. This all-inclusive\napproach helps expand and expedite the availability of resources, capabilities, and solution sets for\nincident response. When severe incidents disrupt community lifelines, private sector and NGO\ncapabilities can assist with stabilizing lifelines and restoring services. Similar to public sector mutual\naid and support agreements, it is essential that government and private sector organizations engage in\ncollaboration before an incident to effectively partner during incident response.\nBusinesses and infrastructure owners and operators have primary responsibility for operating and\nrepairing their systems in emergencies. Businesses and infrastructure owners and operators also have\nunique expertise and capabilities to conduct restoration operations of their own systems, execute\nvoluntary mutual assistance operations within their sectors, and provide valuable resources for cross-\n15\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nsector support. When catastrophic incidents put a premium on the restoration of complex supply chains\n(especially for essential products and services needed for response efforts and stabilizing the economy),\nprivate sector coordination and assets are vital for public health and safety, the economy, and national\nsecurity. The private sector can also help government agencies prioritize support missions (e.g., debris\nremoval) to facilitate business and infrastructure response operations.\nIn coordination with local governments, private sector organizations have a critical role in re-\nestablishing commercial activities and restoring critical infrastructure operations the community\nrequires following a disruption. The resilience of private sector organizations directly affects\ncommunity recovery by providing products and services, employment opportunities, other resources\nand re-establishing a functioning economy. In many cases, private sector organizations also have\nimmediate access to commodities and services that support incident response.\nGovernmental response organizations should coordinate closely with private sector partners to do the\nfollowing:\n Assess cross-sector interdependencies and obstacles to meeting survivor needs;\n Identify opportunities to enable or support prompt stabilization of community lifelines;\n Identify where government support is appropriate and available; and\n Identify opportunities to synchronize response operations with private sector efforts to ensure the\nmost effective approach to reach as many survivors as possible.\nPrivate Sector Coordinating Structures\nCoordinating structures for the private sector include business emergency operations centers (BEOC),\nindustry trade groups and coordinating councils, information sharing and analysis centers, private\nsector information and intelligence centers, and other structural entities, such as healthcare coalitions.\nThese organizations, composed of multiple businesses and entities brought together by shared\ngeography or common function (e.g., banking, supply chain management, transportation, venue, and\nmanagement), support the collaboration, communication, and sharing of information within the private\nsector. Such organizations can coordinate with and support NGOs and, in many cases, serve as a\nconduit to government coordinating structures. Strengthening the relationship between private sector\nand government coordinating structures enhances information sharing and operational response.\nLocally Executed Response\nDuring a disaster, those closest to the impacted areas—individuals, families, neighbors, businesses,\nand emergency responders comprising the community—are the first ones active in response. Local\npartners know their community’s needs, capabilities, and resources best and are positioned to have the\nmost effective impact in the aftermath of an incident. Locally executed response focuses on how the\ncomplex network of local, voluntary, and private sector organizations integrate their capabilities to\nrestore damaged infrastructure, restart the flow of products and services, and place essential items into\nthe hands of survivors. Local governments and communities, therefore, provide the true operational\ncoordination for executing an effective response and can draw on the support of additional state and\nfederal resources when their own resources prove insufficient.\nEmergency responders at all levels of government use NIMS and ICS command and coordinating\nstructures to manage and support response operations (Figure 3). ICS is a management system designed\nto integrate on-scene facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications within a\ncommon organizational structure. Emergency operations centers (EOC) are facilities where staff\n16\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ncoordinate information and resources to support on-scene incident management. Staff in EOCs at all\nlevels of government may also encourage participation by the private sector, including NGOs,\nacademia, associations, and access and functional needs community organizations. Staff in EOCs at\nall levels of government may also encourage participation by private sector elements including NGOs,\nacademia, associations, and organizations representing those with disabilities and others with access\nand functional needs.\nAt the local level, coordinating structures are usually composed of entities within specific functional\nareas, such as public works, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and fire departments. On-\nscene integration among these structures may occur at incident command posts (ICP) and more\nfrequently at one or more local EOCs.\nFigure 3: Example of an ICS organization with a Single Incident Commander20\nIncident management may also involve Multiagency Coordination Groups (MAC Groups). A MAC\nGroup is composed of senior officials, such as agency administrators, executives, or their designees,\nwho are authorized to represent or commit agency resources and funds in support of incident activities.\nA MAC Group acts as an executive- or policy-level body during incidents, supporting resource\nprioritization and allocation, and enabling decision making among elected and appointed officials and\nthose responsible for managing the incident (i.e., the incident commander). In some communities and\njurisdictions, MAC Groups are located at or near EOCs in order to authorize additional resources,\napprove emergency authorities, and provide guidance on issues.\nLocal Coordinating Structures\nLocal jurisdictions and states employ a variety of coordinating structures to help identify risks,\nestablish relationships, and organize and build capabilities. Due to the unique partnerships, geographic\nconditions, threats, and capabilities, the coordinating structures vary. Examples of local response\n20 For more information on NIMS and ICS, see https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1508151197225-\nced8c60378c3936adb92c1a3ee6f6564/FINAL_NIMS_2017.pdf.\n17\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ncoordinating structures include local planning committees, healthcare coalitions,21 Community\nEmergency Response Teams (CERT), and chapters of national-level associations. These local and\nregional coordinating structures organize and integrate their capabilities and resources with\nneighboring jurisdictions, the state, the private sector, and NGOs.\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Managed Response\nState governments serve as agents for local jurisdictions by managing the delivery of federal disaster\nassistance to meet local requirements. While the local incident command structure directs on-scene\nincident management activities and maintains command and control of on-scene incident operations,\nstate EOCs are activated as necessary to support local EOCs and to help ensure that responders have\nthe resources they need to conduct response activities. This is achieved through integration of state-\nlevel coordinating structures working with local coordinating structures or the local incident command\nstructure.\nState, tribal, territorial, and insular area EOCs also provide a common location for coordination of\nstate/tribal/territorial/insular area—and in some cases, federal—support to local EOCs and/or incident\npersonnel. Most states, tribal organizations, territories, and insular areas maintain an EOC to manage\nincidents requiring state-level assistance. Some of these governments have additional EOCs for\ncoordinating information and resources within a region or area.\nMany states involve their tribal counterparts within the EOC to ensure that tribal coordinating\nstructures are integrated into the delivery of capabilities and tribal needs are addressed.\nState, Territorial, and Insular Area Coordinating Structures\nStates, territories, and insular areas also leverage the capabilities and resources of partners across the\nstate/territory/insular area when identifying needs and building capabilities. The coordinating\nstructures at the state, territorial, or insular area level also vary, depending on factors such as\ngeography, population, industry, and the capabilities of the local jurisdictions. These structures are also\ndesigned to leverage appropriate representatives from across the whole community, some of whom\nmay also participate in local or regional coordinating structures. Many states, territories, and insular\nareas create independent committees or councils focused on specific areas or functions as a sub-set of\ntheir emergency management agency.\nTribal Managed Response\nThe United States has a trust responsibility with federally recognized Indian tribes and recognizes their\nright to self-government. This trust doctrine requires the Federal Government to protect tribal treaty\nrights, lands, assets, and resources while providing support through statutory authority and other\nprograms. Under the Stafford Act, federally recognized Indian tribes may directly request their own\nemergency and major declaration or they may request assistance under a state request. In addition,\nfederally recognized Indian tribes can request federal assistance for incidents that impact the tribe but\ndo not result in a Stafford Act declaration. Given their unique position, tribal governments often have\nplanning and response requirements that are the equivalent of state and local operational coordination\nduring an incident.\n21 Healthcare coalitions are multi-agency coordination groups that integrate member organizations with the\njurisdictional agency(s) in the geographic area in which they operate. Healthcare coalitions are invaluable as public-\nprivate partnerships integrating healthcare facilities with emergency medical services, public health, and emergency\nmanagement.\n18\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nTribal Coordinating Structures\nTribal coordinating structures vary depending on a variety of factors, such as individual tribal\ncapabilities, population size, and economic circumstances. Tribes may have internal coordinating\nstructures and facilities for incident response, as well as others that include bordering states and\nneighboring jurisdictions.\nThe Tribal Assistance Coordination Group (TAC-G) is a MAC Group that assists federally recognized\ntribes during emergencies and disasters and provides information and technical assistance for tribal\nemergency management programs in coordination with federal partners. The TAC-G is led and\nmanaged by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Emergency Management Program. The TAC-G consists of\npartners from all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular, or federal), as well as\nnonprofit aid organizations and the private sector.\nFederally Supported Response\nFederal support during response operations focuses on the capabilities necessary to save lives; protect\nproperty and the environment; meet basic human needs; prioritize operations to stabilize community\nlifelines and restore basic services and community functionality; establish a safe, secure, and accessible\nenvironment for responders and response operations; and support the transition to recovery. The\ndesired end-state for federal incident response is achieved when local, state, tribal, territorial, and\ninsular area entities no longer require Federal Government assistance to provide life-saving or life-\nsustaining support, thereby allowing for the transition to recovery.\nWhen an incident occurs that exceeds or is anticipated to exceed local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea resources or when an incident is managed by federal departments or agencies acting under their\nown authorities, the Federal Government may use the management structures described within the\nNRF. Additionally, the Federal Government may use supplementary or complementary plans to\ninvolve all necessary department and agency resources to organize the federal response and ensure\ncoordination among all response partners.\nDifferent federal departments and agencies may play significant roles in response activities, depending\non the nature and size of an incident. Many of the arrangements by which departments and agencies\nparticipate are defined in the ESF annexes coordinated through pre-scripted mission assignments in a\nStafford Act response, formalized in interagency agreements, or described in supplementary plans.\nThe following sections describe federal support operations at the incident, regional, and headquarters\nlevels.\nFederal Incident-level Operations\nTo help deliver federal support or response at the incident level, coordinating structures are aligned to\nincident-level structures.\nUnified Coordination\nUnified coordination is the term used to describe the primary state/tribal/territorial/insular area/federal\nincident management activities conducted at the incident level. Unified coordination is typically\ndirected from a Joint Field Office (JFO), a temporary federal facility that provides a central location\nfor coordination of response efforts by the private sector, NGOs, and all levels of government. Unified\ncoordination is organized, staffed, and managed in a manner consistent with NIMS principles using an\nICS structure. The Unified Coordination Group (UCG) is composed of senior leaders representing\nstate, tribal, territorial, insular area and federal interests and, in certain circumstances, local\n19\n\n\nNational Response Framework\njurisdictions, the private sector, and NGOs. UCG members must have significant jurisdictional\nresponsibility and authority. The composition of the UCG varies from incident to incident, depending\non the scope and nature of the disaster. The UCG leads the unified coordination staff. Personnel from\nstate, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal departments and agencies; other jurisdictional entities;\nthe private sector; and NGOs may be assigned to the unified coordination staff at various incident\nfacilities (e.g., JFOs, staging areas, and other field offices). The UCG determines staffing of the unified\ncoordination staff based on incident requirements.\nAlthough unified coordination is based on the ICS structure, it does not manage on-scene operations.\nInstead, unified coordination supports on-scene response efforts and conducts broader support\noperations that may extend beyond the incident site. Unified coordination must include robust\noperations, planning, public information, and logistics capabilities that integrate local, state, and\nfederal—as well as tribal, territorial, and insular area governments—personnel, when appropriate, so\nthat all levels of government work together to achieve unity of effort.\nWhen incidents affect multiple localities and states or the entire Nation, multiple UCGs with associated\nunified coordination staff may be established. In these situations, coordination occurs according to the\nprinciples of area command, as described in NIMS.\nAs the primary field entity for federal response, unified coordination integrates diverse federal\nauthorities and capabilities and coordinates federal response and recovery operations. Figure 4 shows\na unified coordination organization that might be assembled to deal with a major incident—such as a\nterrorist attack—that includes a law enforcement dimension. Federal agencies that conduct on-scene,\ntactical-level activities may also establish incident and area command structures, generally in\nconjunction with their counterpart local, state, tribal, territorial and/or insular area government\nagencies, to manage that work.\nFigure 4: Unified Coordination\n20\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nEmergency Support Functions as a Coordinating Structure\nESFs are the primary, but not exclusive, response coordinating structures at the federal level.\nCommunities, states, regions, and other tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal departments and\nagencies may use the ESF construct, or they may employ other coordinating structures or partners\nappropriate to their location, threats, or authorities. Whatever structures are used, they are encouraged\nto work closely with federal ESFs at the incident, regional, or headquarters levels if they are activated.\nThe Federal Government and many state governments organize their response resources and\ncapabilities under the ESF construct. Each ESF is composed of a department or agency that has been\ndesignated as the ESF coordinator, along with a number of primary and support agencies. Primary\nagencies are designated on the basis of their authorities, resources, and capabilities. Support agencies\nare assigned based on resources or capabilities in a given functional area. To the extent possible,\nresources provided by the ESFs are identified consistently with NIMS resource typing categories.\nESFs have proven to be an effective way to organize and manage resources to deliver core capabilities.\nThe federal ESFs are the primary, but not exclusive, federal coordinating structures for building,\nsustaining, and delivering the response core capabilities.\nAt the federal level, ESFs are groups of organizations that work together to deliver core capabilities to\nstabilize community lifelines in support of an effective response. Any ESF may assist in the delivery\nof a response core capability. Because a core capability may be required, each ESF can contribute to\nthe stabilization of any of the community lifelines, depending on the circumstances of the incident.\nTable 3 provides an example of actions each ESF may take to support incident issues arising within\nthe health and medical lifeline; these actions may impact more than one of the other community\nlifelines.\nTable 3: Example Actions That an ESF May Take in Support of Stabilizing the Health and Medical\nLifeline During Incident Response Operations\nESF Example Supporting Actions or Capabilities\nCoordinate the opening of roads and manage aviation airspace for\nESF #1 Transportation\naccess to health and medical facilities or services.\nProvide and enable contingency communications required at health and\nESF #2 Communications\nmedical facilities.\nESF #3 Public Works & Install generators and provide other temporary emergency power\nEngineering sources for health and medical facilities.\nCoordinates federal firefighting activities and supports resource\nESF #4 Firefighting\nrequests for public health and medical facilities and teams.\nESF #5 Information & Develop coordinated interagency crisis action plans addressing health\nPlanning and medical issues.\nESF #6 Mass Care,\nIntegrate voluntary agency and other partner support, including other\nEmergency Assistance,\nfederal agencies and the private sector, to resource health and medical\nTemporary Housing, &\nservices and supplies.\nHuman Assistance\nProvide logistics support for moving meals, water, or other\nESF #7 Logistics\ncommodities.\nESF #8 Public Health & Provide health and medical support to communities, and coordinate\nMedical Services across capabilities of partner agencies.\nESF #9 Search & Rescue Conduct initial health and medical needs assessments.\n21\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nESF Example Supporting Actions or Capabilities\nESF #10 Oil & Hazardous Monitor air quality near health and medical facilities in close proximity to\nMaterials Response the incident area.\nESF #11 Agriculture & Coordinate with health and medical entities to address incidents of\nNatural Resources zoonotic disease.\nCoordinate power restoration efforts for health and medical facilities or\nESF #12 Energy\npower-dependent medical populations.\nESF #13 Public Safety & Provide public safety needed security at health and medical facilities or\nSecurity mobile teams delivering services.\nBe informed of and assess cascading impacts of health or medical\nESF #14 Cross-Sector\ninfrastructure or service disruptions, and deconflict or prioritize cross-\nBusiness and Infrastructure\nsector requirements.\nConduct public messaging on the status of available health and medical\nESF #15 External Affairs\nservices or public health risks.\nAdditional detail on the scope of each ESF can be found in the Emergency Support Function Roles and\nResponsibilities section.\nAs previously noted, many local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area jurisdictions have adopted\nand tailored the ESF construct. Because these jurisdictions established ESFs based on their specific\nrisks and requirements, there is no mandatory or direct linkage to the federal ESFs. Governments are\nencouraged to engage members of the whole community as part of whatever coordinating processes\nthey use.\nDepartments and agencies supporting federal ESFs may be selectively activated by FEMA or as\nrequested by a lead federal agency to support response activities for incidents. Not all incidents\nrequiring federal support result in the activation of ESFs.\nWhen departments and agencies supporting federal ESFs are activated, they may assign staff at\nheadquarters, regional, and incident levels. Through the Stafford Act and in accordance with 6 U.S.C.\nSections 741(4) and 753(c), FEMA may issue mission assignments to obtain resources and services\nfrom federal departments and agencies.\nIncidents Without a Stafford Act Declaration\nMost incidents where the NRF serves as the foundational federal response doctrine will not result in a\nfederally declared disaster under the Stafford Act. For example, pre-incident operations for hurricanes,\nresponses to biological incidents, electric grid emergencies, oil spills, migration crises, public health\nemergencies, and a host of other threats and hazards may not receive a Presidential disaster declaration\nbut still require a coordinated national response.\nFor such non-Stafford Act incidents where the Federal Government is involved, the President may\ndesignate or the federal agencies involved may agree to recognize an agency to serve as the Lead\nFederal Agency (LFA) for the response. The LFA typically activates the response structures\nappropriate to its authorities. The LFA employs NIMS and this Framework to coordinate the federal\nresponse. Details regarding federal operations for non-Stafford incidents are contained within the\nrelevant statutes and policies. Because the NRF is always in effect, ESFs may be activated and\ndeployed to help manage any response in support of the LFA.\n22\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFederal Regional Operational Support\nCoordinating structures can be assembled and organized at the regional level to address incidents that\ncross state or international borders or have broad geographic or system-wide implications or to manage\ncompeting requirements for response assets among multiple incidents.\nFederal Regional Facilities\nMost federal departments and agencies have regional or field offices that may participate with local,\nstate, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments in planning for incidents and provide response\nassets when an incident occurs in their jurisdiction. Some federal departments and agencies share the\nsame standard federal regional structure as FEMA. In larger-scale incidents, these regional and field\noffices may provide the initial response assets with additional support being provided from other\ndepartment and agency offices across the Nation. Some federal regional and field offices have their\nown EOCs to support deployments of their assets.\n FEMA Regional Response Coordination Center (RRCC). FEMA has 10 regional offices, each\nheaded by a Regional Administrator. Each of FEMA’s regional offices maintains an RRCC. When\nactivated, RRCCs are multi-agency coordination centers generally staffed by regional FEMA\npersonnel and augmented by ESFs and other federal agencies in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing an incident. Operating under the direction of the FEMA Regional Administrator, the\nstaff within the RRCCs coordinates federal regional response efforts and maintains connectivity\nwith FEMA Headquarters and with state EOCs, state and major urban area fusion centers, Federal\nExecutive Boards, tribal governments, and other federal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\noperations and coordination centers that potentially contribute to the development of situational\nawareness. The UCG assumes responsibility for coordinating federal response activities at the\nincident level once unified coordination is established, freeing the RRCC to deal with new\nincidents should they occur.\n Joint Operations Center (JOC). In response to significant threats within the criminal jurisdiction\nof the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may establish a JOC, which is a\nregional multi-jurisdictional, interagency operations center to lead and coordinate the operational\nlaw enforcement response, including but not limited to investigative operations and related\nintelligence activities. The JOC is led by an FBI on-scene commander (OSC) and is supported by\na command group and a consequence management group, as appropriate. If the threat involves\npotential attacks or threats spanning multiple geographic areas, then multiple JOCs may be\nestablished. The JOC acts as the focal point for the strategic management and direction of on scene\nlaw enforcement activities and coordination with local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\nauthorities. Additionally, the FBI OSC may be supported by the Domestic Emergency Support\nTeam (if deployed), which may provide interagency technical or scientific expertise.\nFederal Headquarters Operational Support\nCoordinating structures are assembled and organized at the federal headquarters level, particularly to\naddress incidents that cross regional borders or have broad geographic or system-wide implications.\nFederal Operations Centers\nMost Cabinet-level and some other federal departments and agencies have headquarters-level\noperations centers. A wide range of such centers maintain situational awareness within their functional\n23\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nareas and provide relevant information to the DHS National Operations Center (NOC)22 during an\nincident. These operations centers may also coordinate ESF activities, communicate with other federal\noperations centers, and communicate with their local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\ngovernment counterparts. Examples of FOCs include the following:\n National Operations Center. In the event of an act of terrorism, natural disaster, or other\nemergency, the NOC, as the principal operations center for DHS, coordinates and integrates\ninformation from the NOC components to provide situational awareness and a common operating\npicture for the entire Federal Government, as well as for local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular\narea governments, as appropriate, to ensure that accurate and critical terrorism and disaster-related\ninformation reaches government decision makers in a timely manner. Additionally, the NOC serves\nas the national fusion center, collecting and synthesizing all-source information, including\ninformation from state and major urban area fusion centers, for all threats and hazards across the\nentire integrated National Preparedness System.\n National Response Coordination Center. When activated, the NRCC is a multiagency\ncoordination center located at FEMA Headquarters. NRCC’s staff coordinates the overall federal\nsupport for major disasters and emergencies, including catastrophic incidents and emergency\nmanagement program implementation. FEMA maintains the NRCC as a functional component of\nthe NOC for incident support operations.\nThe National Business Emergency Operations Center is a FEMA component within the\nNRCC that acts as mechanism for information sharing between public and private sector\nstakeholders. The NRCC also includes the public affairs function of ESF #15, which acts\nas a mechanism to synchronize external messaging among all impacted and responding\norganizations.\n Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Integrated Operations\nCoordination Center (CIOCC). The CIOCC is composed of the National Cybersecurity and\nCommunications Integration Center, the National Infrastructure Coordinating Center, and the\nNational Coordinating Center for Communications. It is the focal point for federal partners, the\nprivate sector, and local, state, tribal, and territorial governments to obtain situational awareness,\ntechnical assistance, and integrated, actionable information to secure and defend the Nation’s\ncyber, physical, and communications infrastructure. The CIOCC operates around the clock to\nintegrate, coordinate, and share risk and threat information with the critical infrastructure\ncommunity, perform consequence analyses of incidents affecting critical infrastructure, inform\ndecision making, provide technical expertise to address cyber threats and communications outages,\nand coordinate infrastructure-related support for broader federal response efforts.\n National Military Command Center (NMCC). The Department of Defense’s (DoD) NMCC is\nthe Nation’s focal point for continuous monitoring and coordination of worldwide military\noperations. The NMCC directly supports combatant commanders, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs\nof Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the President in the command of U.S. Armed Forces in\npeacetime contingencies and war. The NMCC participates in a wide variety of activities, ranging\nfrom missile warning and attack assessment to management of peacetime operations, such as\n22 The NOC is composed of the NOC Watch, Intelligence Watch, FEMA National Watch Center, National Response\nCoordination Center, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Integrated Operations Coordination\nCenter.\n24\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ndefense support of civil authorities during special events, major disasters, and national\nemergencies.\n Strategic Information and Operations Center (SIOC). The SIOC acts as the FBI’s worldwide\nEOC. The SIOC maintains situational awareness of criminal or terrorist threats and critical\nincidents and crises (foreign and domestic, regardless of cause or origin) and provides FBI\nheadquarters executives, domestic field offices, and overseas legal attachés with timely notification\nand the dissemination of strategic information. The SIOC shares information and intelligence with\nother EOCs at all levels of government. Maintaining a constant state of readiness to support any\ncrisis or major event, the SIOC provides a secure venue to support crisis management, special event\nmonitoring, and significant operations. The SIOC provides command, control, communications\nconnectivity, and a common operating picture for managing FBI operational responses and assets\nthroughout the world on behalf of FBI Headquarters, divisions, field offices, and legal attachés. In\nthe event of a crisis, the SIOC establishes the headquarters command post and develops\nconnectivity to field command posts and JOCs. The FBI-led Weapons of Mass Destruction\nStrategic Group is activated within the SIOC when facing weapons of mass destruction terrorist\nthreats. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Strategic Group is an interagency crisis action team that\nsupports information exchange and the deconfliction of counterterrorism activities.\nThe specific structures activated for a given incident depend on the levels of government involved, as\nwell as the legal authorities under which the response is being conducted.\nNational Security Council\nThe National Security Council (NSC) is the principal policy body for consideration of national security\npolicy issues requiring Presidential determination. The NSC advises and assists the President in\nintegrating all aspects of national security policy as it affects the United States—domestic, foreign,\nmilitary, intelligence, and economic (in conjunction with the National Economic Council).\nRoles and Responsibilities for Response\nThis section describes those roles and responsibilities and sharpens the focus on identifying who is\ninvolved with the response mission area. This section also addresses what the various partners must do\nto deliver the response core capabilities and to integrate successfully with the prevention, protection,\nmitigation, and recovery mission areas.\nAn effective, unified national response requires layered, mutually supporting capabilities. Individuals\nand communities, the private sector, NGOs, and all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial,\ninsular area, and federal) should each understand their respective roles and responsibilities and how to\ncomplement each other in achieving shared goals. All elements of the whole community play roles in\ndeveloping the core capabilities needed to respond to incidents. This includes developing plans that\nensure continuity of operations, conducting assessments and exercises, providing and directing\nresources and capabilities, and gathering lessons-learned. These activities require that all partners\nunderstand how they fit within and are supported by the structures described in the NRF.\nEmergency management staff in all jurisdictions and organizations have a fundamental responsibility\nto consider the needs of the whole community. These needs must be incorporated into response\nplanning and delivery of the core capabilities. The potential contributions of all individuals toward\ndelivering core capabilities during incident response (e.g., through associations and alliances that serve\nthe people previously identified) should be incorporated into planning efforts.\n25\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nEmergency management staff must also consider those who own or have responsibility for animals,\nboth as members of the community who may be affected by incidents and as a potential means of\nsupporting response efforts. This includes those with household pets, service and assistance animals,\nworking dogs, and agricultural animals/livestock, as well as those who have responsibility for wildlife,\nexotic animals, zoo animals, research animals, and animals housed in shelters, rescue organizations,\nbreeding facilities, and sanctuaries.\nCommunities\nCommunities are groups that share goals, values, and institutions. Communities are not always limited\nby geographic boundaries or political divisions. Instead, communities may be faith-based\norganizations; voluntary organizations; neighborhood partnerships; advocacy groups; academia;\ncultural, social, and community groups; and associations. Communities bring people together in\ndifferent ways for different reasons, but each community provides opportunities for sharing\ninformation and promoting collective action. These communities may have resources and information\nto stabilize community lifelines. Engaging these groups in preparedness efforts, particularly at the\nlocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area levels, is important to identifying their needs and taking\nadvantage of their potential contributions.\nPrivate Sector\nPrivate sector organizations engage in incident response through their own internal response and\ncontinuity actions, the commodities they provide, their partnerships with each level of government,\nand their roles within the supply chain. Elements of the private sector are most often the providers of\ncommunity lifeline services and have a key interest in the stabilization and restoration of their own\noperations and those of other infrastructure systems. Private sector organizations also play a vital role\nin ensuring communities and survivors have the services and resources necessary to respond to and\nrecover from all types of incidents. The private sector, comprised of small, medium, and large\nbusinesses, spans nationally significant infrastructure to locally owned and operated businesses that,\nwhile small, are staples of the community. The private sector includes commerce; healthcare; private,\ncultural, and educational institutions; and industry, as well as public/private partnerships that have been\nestablished specifically for emergency management purposes. During an incident, key private sector\npartners should have a direct link to emergency managers and other relevant officials, such as those\nfrom public health, economic development, and community planning agencies and, in some cases, be\ninvolved in the decision-making process. Strong integration into response efforts can offer many\nbenefits to the public and private sectors.\nAs key elements of the national economy, it is important for private sector organizations of all types\nand sizes to engage in preparedness planning, conduct risk assessments, and identify critical\ncommunity lifelines, functions, and resources that impact their businesses and communities.\nUnderstanding and collaborating on the cross-sector interdependencies and cascading effects of a\npotentially high-consequence incident on business, infrastructure, and supply chains improves\ncommunity resilience and can help private sector organizations to quickly resume normal operations.\nUltimately, the ability of the private sector to recover is inextricably linked to community recovery.\nOwners and operators of certain regulated facilities or hazardous operations may be legally responsible\nfor preparing for and preventing incidents and responding when an incident occurs. For example, the\nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, and associated regulations require owners and operators of\ncommercial nuclear powerplants and offsite response organizations (OROs) to maintain emergency\nplans in order protect the health and safety of the public. Onsite response organizations and OROs\nperform exercises, assessments, notifications, and training for incident response. Because of their\n26\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nsignificance in providing essential functions and services, it is vital that private critical infrastructure\nsectors, such as privately-owned transportation and transit, telecommunications, utilities, financial\ninstitutions, hospitals, and other health-related facilities, create and sustain effective business\ncontinuity plans.\nPrivate sector entities may serve as partners in local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area emergency\npreparedness and response organizations and activities and with federal sector-specific agencies.\nPrivate sector entities often participate in local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area preparedness\nactivities by providing resources (donated or compensated) during an incident—including specialized\nteams, essential services, equipment, and advanced technologies—through local public-private\nemergency plans or mutual aid and assistance agreements or in response to requests from government\nand nongovernmental initiatives.\nRestoring economic activity in an impacted area is fundamental to the recovery of the community.\nExamples of key private sector activities that support this effort include the following:\n Planning, training, and exercising their response capabilities;\n Planning for, responding to, and recovering from incidents that impact their own infrastructure and\nfacilities;\n Protecting information, and maintaining the continuity of business operations in order to ensure\nthe integrity of supply chains or quickly establishing new supply chains to stabilize the community\nand reduce human suffering;\n Providing assistance specified under mutual aid and assistance agreements;\n Addressing the welfare of employees (including disbursement of wages);\n Executing their own immediate response activities and meeting the continuity needs of\ninfrastructure, facilities, and business operations;\n Collaborating with emergency management personnel to determine what assistance may be\nrequired and how they can provide needed support;\n Contributing to communication and information-sharing efforts during incidents, and providing\ninsight on the scope and scale of impacts;\n Identifying requirements for public sector support to enable stabilization of critical community\nlifelines; and\n Contributing resources, personnel, and expertise; helping to shape objectives; and receiving\ninformation about the status of the community.\nIndividuals, Families, and Households\nIndividuals, families, and households reduce potential emergency response requirements and hazards\nin and around their homes by efforts such as raising utilities above flood level or securing unanchored\nobjects against the threat of high winds. Individuals, families, and households should also prepare\nemergency supply kits and emergency plans, so they can take care of themselves and their neighbors\nuntil assistance arrives. Information on emergency preparedness can be found at many local, state,\ntribal, territorial, insular area, voluntary organization, and federal emergency management Websites,\nsuch as http://www.ready.gov.\nIndividuals can also contribute to the preparedness and resilience of their households and communities\nby volunteering with emergency organizations (e.g., the local chapter of the American Red Cross,\n27\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nMedical Reserve Corps, Community Emergency Response Teams, or National Voluntary\nOrganizations Active in Disaster [National VOAD]) and completing emergency response training\ncourses. Individuals who have access and functional or medical needs should make preparations with\nfamily members. Their plans should include provisions for personal assistance service providers and\nany household pets or service and assistance animals. During an actual disaster, emergency, or threat,\nindividuals, households, and families should monitor emergency communications and follow guidance\nand instructions provided by local authorities.\nNongovernmental Organizations\nNGOs are a distinct category of organizations within the private sector that can support disaster\nresponse and recovery. NGOs include voluntary, ethnic, faith-based, veteran-based, disability, and\nnonprofit organizations that provide sheltering, emergency food supplies, and other essential support\nservices for people, household pets, and service animals. NGOs are inherently independent and\ncommitted to specific interests and values. These interests and values drive the groups’ operational\npriorities and shape the resources they provide. NGOs bolster government efforts at all levels and often\nprovide specialized services to the whole community. NGOs are key partners in preparedness activities\nand response operations.\nExamples of NGO contributions include the following:\n Training, management, and coordination of volunteers and donated goods;\n Ensuring staff are screened, trained, and able to safely perform their tasks;\n Identifying sheltering locations, ensuring access to those facilities, and communicating their\nlocations to the whole community;\n Providing emergency commodities and services, such as water, food, shelter, assistance with\nfamily reunification, clothing, and supplies for post-emergency cleanup;\n Supporting the evacuation, rescue, care, and sheltering of animals displaced by the incident;\n Supporting search and rescue, transportation, and logistics services and support;\n Identifying and supporting the unmet needs of survivors who have been affected by the disaster;\n Identifying and supporting the heath, medical, mental health, and behavior health resources of the\nimpacted community; and\n Supporting disaster survivors, identifying unmet needs, and developing individual recovery plans.\nAt the same time, when NGOs support response core capabilities they may also require government\nassistance. When planning for local community emergency management resources, government\norganizations should consider the potential need to support NGOs in performing their essential\nresponse functions. Volunteers and donors support response efforts in many ways. Governments at all\nlevels must plan ahead to incorporate volunteers and donated resources into response activities. Close\ncollaboration with the voluntary organizations and agencies assists in managing the influx of\nvolunteers and donations. Additional information can be found in the Volunteers and Donations\nManagement Support Annex.\nSome NGOs and functions are officially designated as support elements to national response\ncapabilities, such as the following:\n The American Red Cross. The American Red Cross is chartered by Congress to provide relief to\nsurvivors of disasters and help people prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from\n28\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nemergencies. The Red Cross has a legal status of a “federal chartered instrumentality” and\nmaintains a special relationship with the Federal Government.23 In this capacity, the American Red\nCross is the co-lead of ESF #6 and supports several other ESFs and the delivery of multiple core\ncapabilities.\n National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.24 National VOAD is an association of\norganizations that mitigates and alleviates the impact of disasters; provides a forum promoting\ncooperation, communication, coordination and collaboration; and fosters more effective delivery\nof services to communities impacted by a disaster. National VOAD is a consortium of over\n70 national organizations and 56 territorial and state equivalents.\n National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). Within the NCMEC, the\nNational Emergency Child Locator Center facilitates the expeditious identification and\nreunification of children with their families.\nLocal Government\nThe responsibility for responding to natural and human-caused incidents that have recognizable\ngeographic boundaries generally begins at the local level with individuals and public officials in the\ncounty, parish, city, or town affected by an incident. The following paragraphs describe the\nresponsibilities of specific local officials who have emergency management responsibilities.\nChief Elected or Appointed Official\nJurisdictional chief executives are responsible for the public safety and welfare of the people of their\njurisdiction. Officials provide strategic guidance and resources across all five mission areas. Chief\nelected or appointed officials must have a clear understanding of their emergency management roles\nand responsibilities and how to apply the response core capabilities because they may need to make\ndecisions regarding resources and operations during an incident to stabilize community lifelines. Lives\nmay depend on their decisions. Elected and appointed officials also routinely shape or modify laws,\npolicies, and budgets to aid preparedness efforts and improve emergency management and response\ncapabilities. The local chief executive’s response duties may include the following:\n Obtaining assistance from other governmental agencies,\n Providing direction for response activities, and\n Ensuring appropriate information is provided to the public.\nLocal Emergency Manager\nThe jurisdiction’s emergency manager oversees the day-to-day emergency management programs and\nactivities. The emergency manager works with chief elected and appointed officials to establish unified\nobjectives regarding the jurisdiction’s emergency plans and activities. This role entails coordinating\nand integrating all elements of the community. The emergency manager coordinates the local\nemergency management program. This includes assessing the capacity and readiness to deliver the\ncapabilities most likely required to stabilize community lifelines during an incident and identifying\nand correcting shortfalls. The local emergency manager’s duties often include the following:\n Advising elected and appointed officials during a response;\n23 36 U.S.C. Chapter 3001: The American Red Cross.\n24 Additional information is available at https://www.nvoad.org/.\n29\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Conducting response operations in accordance with the NIMS.\n Coordinating the functions of local agencies;\n Coordinating the development of plans, and working cooperatively with other local agencies,\ncommunity organizations, private sector businesses, and NGOs;\n Developing and maintaining mutual aid and assistance agreements;\n Coordinating resource requests during an incident through the management of an emergency\noperations center;\n Coordinating damage assessments during an incident;\n Advising and informing local officials and the public about emergency management activities\nduring an incident to facilitate response operations such as sheltering, avoiding, evacuating, and\nresupply of food and water;\n Developing and executing accessible public awareness and education programs;\n Conducting exercises to rehearse response activities; test personnel, plans and systems; and\nidentify areas for improvement;\n Coordinating integration of individuals with disabilities, individuals from racially and ethnically\ndiverse backgrounds, and others with access and functional needs into emergency planning and\nresponse; and\n Helping to ensure the continuation of essential services and functions through the development and\nimplementation of continuity of operations plans.\nOther Local Departments and Agencies\nLocal government department and agency heads collaborate with the emergency manager during the\ndevelopment of local emergency plans and provide key response resources. Participation in the\nplanning process helps to ensure that specific capabilities are integrated into a workable plan to\nsafeguard the community. The department and agency heads and their staffs develop, plan, and train\non internal policies and procedures to meet response needs safely, and they participate in interagency\ntraining and exercises to develop and maintain necessary capabilities.\nSimilar to the federal and state level, local emergency management agencies are not the\nonly entities involved in incident response. Local departments, agencies, and offices, such\nas those for emergency medical services, economic development, public health, law\nenforcement, fire, public works, land use planning, building construction, and animal\ncontrol, as well as other administrative elements of local government, have a significant\nrole to play and provide valuable perspective, depending on the incident.\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Government\nState, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments are responsible for the health and welfare of their\nresidents, communities, lands, and cultural heritage.\nStates\nState governments supplement local efforts before, during, and after incidents by applying in-state\nresources first. When an incident expands or has the potential to expand beyond the capability of a\n30\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nlocal jurisdiction and responders cannot meet the needs with mutual aid and assistance resources, local\nofficials contact the state.\nUpon receiving a request for assistance from a local or tribal government, state officials may do the\nfollowing:\n Coordinate warnings and public information through the activation of the state’s public\ncommunications strategy;\n Distribute supplies stockpiled to meet the needs of the emergency;\n Provide technical assistance and support to meet the response and recovery needs;\n Suspend or waive statutes, rules, ordinances, and orders, to the extent permitted by law, to ensure\ntimely performance of response functions;\n Implement state volunteer and donations management plans, and coordinate with the private sector\nand voluntary organizations;\n Order or recommend evacuations ensuring the integration and inclusion of the requirements of\npopulations such as children; individuals with disabilities and others with access and functional\nneeds; those from religious, racial, and ethnically diverse communities; people with limited English\nproficiency; and owners of animals, including household pets and service and assistance animals;\nand\n Mobilize resources to meet the requirements of individuals with disabilities and others with access\nand functional needs in compliance with federal civil rights laws.\nIf additional resources are required, states can request assistance from other states through interstate\nmutual aid and assistance agreements such as the Emergency Management Assistance Compact\n(EMAC). Administered by the National Emergency Management Association, EMAC is an interstate\nmutual aid agreement that streamlines the interstate mutual aid and assistance process. If a state\nanticipates that its resources may be exceeded, the governor25 may request assistance from the Federal\nGovernment through a Stafford Act declaration.\nThe following paragraphs describe some of the roles and responsibilities of key officials, as well as\nother departments and agencies.\nGovernor\nThe public safety and welfare of a state’s residents are the fundamental responsibilities of every\ngovernor. The governor coordinates state resources and provides the strategic guidance for response to\nall types of incidents. This includes supporting local governments, as needed, and coordinating\nassistance with other states and the Federal Government. A governor also does the following during\nresponse:\n In accordance with state law, may make, amend, or suspend certain orders or regulations associated\nwith response efforts;\n Communicates to the public in an accessible manner (i.e., effective communications to address all\nmembers of the whole community), and helps people, businesses, and organizations cope with the\nconsequences of and protective actions for any type of incident;\n Coordinates with tribal governments within the state; and\n25 “Governor” is used throughout this document to refer to the chief executive of states, territories, and insular areas.\n31\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Commands the state military forces (National Guard personnel not in federal service and state\ndefense forces).\nState Homeland Security Adviser\nMany states have designated homeland security advisers who serve as counsel to the governor on\nhomeland security issues and may serve as a liaison between the governor’s office, the state homeland\nsecurity structure, and other organizations inside and outside of the state. The advisor may chair a\ncommittee composed of representatives of relevant state agencies, including public safety, the National\nGuard, emergency management, public health, environment, agriculture, and others charged with\ndeveloping prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery strategies.\nState Emergency Management Agency Director\nAll states have laws mandating the establishment of a state emergency management agency, as well as\nthe emergency plans coordinated by that agency. The director of the state emergency management\nagency is responsible for ensuring that the state is prepared to deal with large-scale emergencies and\ncoordinating the statewide response to such incidents. This includes supporting local and tribal\ngovernments, as needed; coordinating assistance with other states and the Federal Government; and,\nin some cases, with NGOs and private sector organizations. The state emergency management agency\nmay dispatch personnel to assist in the response and recovery effort.\nNational Guard\nThe National Guard is an important state resource available for planning, preparing, and responding to\nnatural or human-caused incidents.26 National Guard members have expertise in critical areas, such as\nemergency medical response; communications; logistics; search and rescue; civil engineering;\nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response and planning; and decontamination.\nThe governor may order members of the National Guard to state active-duty status to support state\nfunctions and activities. The governor or the state adjutant general may assign members of the National\nGuard to assist with state, regional, and federal emergency management plans. In American Samoa,\nthe governor coordinates response activities with the U.S. Army Reserve because it is the sole U.S.\nterritory with no National Guard.\nOther State Departments and Agencies\nState department and agency heads and their staffs develop, plan, and train on internal policies and\nprocedures to meet response and recovery needs. As discussed earlier, these departments and agencies\nrepresent the full range of authorities and resources of the state government, such as law enforcement,\ntransportation, housing, economic development, public works, health, social services, and agriculture.\nState department and agency heads also provide important links to regional voluntary organizations,\nbusiness, and industry. Staff from these departments and agencies also participate in interagency\ntraining and exercises to develop and maintain the necessary capabilities and share resources through\nmutual aid agreements. State department and agency heads are vital to the state’s overall emergency\nmanagement program because they bring expertise spanning various response functions and serve as\ncore members of the state EOC and ICP. Many state department and agency heads have direct\n26 The President may order National Guard forces to active duty (e.g., sections 12302 or 12304 of title 10, U.S.C.),\ncall National Guard forces into Federal service (e.g., the Insurrection Act), or request National Guard force support of\nDoD operations or missions (e.g., section 502(f) of title 32 U.S.C.) in the United States. When ordered to active duty\nor called into Federal service, National Guard forces operate under the command of the Secretary of Defense.\n32\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nexperience in providing accessible and vital services to the whole community during response\noperations. State departments and agencies typically work in close coordination with their federal\ncounterpart agencies during joint state and federal responses, and under some federal laws, they may\nrequest assistance from these federal partners.\nTribes\nIn accordance with the Stafford Act, the chief executive27 of an affected Indian tribal government may\nsubmit a request for a declaration by the President. Tribal governments are responsible for coordinating\nresources to address actual or potential incidents. When coordinating with tribes, language and cultural\ndifferences must be considered, as well as overlapping authorities.\nTribes are encouraged to build relationships with local jurisdictions and states because these entities\nmay have resources most readily available. The NRF’s Tribal Coordination Support Annex outlines\nprocesses and mechanisms that tribal governments may use to request federal assistance during an\nincident.\nChief Executive\nThe chief executive is responsible for the public safety and welfare of his/her respective tribe. The\nchief executive coordinates tribal resources and helps guide the response to all types of incidents. This\nincludes coordinating assistance with states, as well as the Federal Government. The chief executive\ndoes the following during response:\n In accordance with the law, may make, amend, or suspend certain orders or regulations associated\nwith the response;\n Communicates with the public in an accessible manner, and helps people, businesses, and\norganizations cope with the consequences of all types of incidents;\n Negotiates mutual aid and assistance agreements with other local jurisdictions, states, tribes,\nterritories, and insular area governments; and\n Can request federal assistance.\nTerritorial and Insular Area Governments\nTerritorial and insular area governments are responsible for coordinating resources to address actual\nor potential incidents and have many of the same functions states have, as previously listed in this\nsection. Because of their remote locations, territorial and insular area governments often face unique\nchallenges in receiving assistance from outside the jurisdiction quickly and often request assistance\nfrom neighboring islands, other nearby countries, states, the private sector or NGO resources, or the\nFederal Government. Additionally, there are language and cultural differences that must be considered,\nas well as the potential for authorities that overlap with federal authorities.\nTerritorial/Insular Area Leader\nThe territorial/insular area leader is responsible for the public safety and welfare of the people of his/her\njurisdiction. As authorized by the territorial or insular area government, the leader does the following:\n Coordinates resources needed to respond to incidents of all types;\n27 The Stafford Act uses the term “chief executive” to refer to the person who is the chief, chairman, governor,\npresident, or similar executive official of an Indian tribal government.\n33\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n In accordance with the law, may make, amend, or suspend certain orders or regulations associated\nwith the response;\n Communicates with the public in an accessible manner, and helps people, businesses, and\norganizations cope with the consequences of all types of incidents;\n Commands the territory’s military forces;\n Negotiates mutual aid and assistance agreements with other local jurisdictions, states, tribes,\nterritories, and insular area governments; and\n Can request federal assistance.\nFederal Government\nThe Federal Government maintains a wide range of capabilities and resources that may be required to\ndeal with domestic incidents in order to save lives and protect property and the environment while\nensuring the protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties and supporting the stabilization of\ncommunity lifelines. To be successful, any approach to the delivery of response capabilities will\nrequire an all-of-nation approach. All federal departments and agencies must cooperate with one\nanother and with local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments, community members,\nvoluntary organizations, and the private sector to the maximum extent possible.\nThe Federal Government becomes involved with a response when federal interests are involved; when\nlocal, state, tribal, territorial, or insular resources are insufficient and federal assistance is requested;\nor as authorized or required by statute, regulation, or policy. Accordingly, in some instances, the\nFederal Government may play a supporting role to local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular area\nauthorities by providing federal assistance to the affected parties. For example, the Federal\nGovernment provides assistance to local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area authorities when the\nPresident declares a major disaster or emergency under the Stafford Act. In other instances, the Federal\nGovernment may play a leading role in the response where the Federal Government has primary\njurisdiction or when incidents occur on federal property (e.g., national parks and military bases).\nRegardless of the type of incident, the President leads the Federal Government response effort to ensure\nthat the necessary resources are applied quickly and efficiently to large-scale and catastrophic\nincidents. Different federal departments or agencies lead coordination of the Federal Government’s\nresponse, depending on the type and magnitude of the incident, and are also supported by other\nagencies that bring their relevant capabilities to bear in responding to the incident.\nSecretary of Homeland Security\nIn conjunction with these efforts, the statutory mission of DHS is to act as a focal point regarding\nnatural and human-caused crises and emergency planning. Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act and\nPresidential directive, the Secretary of Homeland Security is the principal federal official for domestic\nincident management. The Secretary of Homeland Security coordinates preparedness activities within\nthe United States to respond to and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other\nemergencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security coordinates with federal entities to provide for\nfederal unity of efforts for domestic incident management. As part of these responsibilities, the\nSecretary of Homeland Security does the following during response:\n Provides the executive branch with an overall architecture for domestic incident management, and\ncoordinates the federal response, as required; and\n34\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Monitors activities, assesses risk, and activates specific response mechanisms to support other\nfederal departments and agencies without assuming the overall coordination of the federal response\nduring incidents that do not require the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate the response\nor do not result in a Stafford Act declaration.\nOther federal departments and agencies carry out their response authorities and responsibilities within\nthis overarching construct of DHS coordination.\nUnity of effort differs from unity of command. Various federal departments and agencies may have\nstatutory responsibilities and lead roles based on the unique circumstances of the incident. Unity of\neffort provides coordination through cooperation and common interests and does not interfere with\nfederal departments’ and agencies’ supervisory, command, or statutory authorities. The Secretary of\nHomeland Security does the following during response:\n Ensures that overall federal actions are unified, complete, and synchronized to prevent unfilled\ngaps in the Federal Government’s overarching effort. This coordinated approach ensures that the\nfederal actions undertaken by DHS and other departments and agencies are harmonized and\nmutually supportive.\n Executes these coordination responsibilities, in part, by engaging directly with the President and\nrelevant Cabinet, department, agency, and DHS component heads, as is necessary, to ensure a\nfocused, efficient, and unified federal preparedness posture. All federal departments and agencies,\nin turn, cooperate with the Secretary of Homeland Security in executing domestic incident\nmanagement duties.\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security’s responsibilities also include management of the broad\nemergency management and response authorities of FEMA and other DHS components. DHS\ncomponent heads may have lead response roles or other significant roles, depending on the type and\nseverity of the incident. For example, the U.S. Secret Service is the lead agency for security design,\nplanning, and implementation of national special security events, while the Assistant Director for\nCybersecurity for DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) coordinates the\nresponse to significant cyber incidents.\nFEMA Administrator\nThe FEMA Administrator is the principal adviser to the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security,\nand the National Security Council regarding emergency management. The FEMA Administrator’s\nduties include the following:\n Assisting the President, through the Secretary of Homeland Security, in carrying out the Stafford\nAct, operation of the NRCC and RRCCs, the effective support of all ESFs, and, more generally,\npreparation for, protection against, response to, and recovery from all types of incidents.\n Reporting to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the FEMA Administrator is also responsible for\nmanaging the core DHS grant programs supporting homeland security activities.28\nAttorney General\nThe Attorney General has lead responsibility for criminal investigations of terrorist acts or terrorist\nthreats by individuals or groups inside the United States or directed at U.S. citizens or institutions\nabroad, where such acts are within the federal criminal jurisdiction of the United States. The Attorney\n28 See the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, enacted as part of the Fiscal Year 2007 DHS\nAppropriations Act, Public Law 109-295.\n35\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nGeneral is also responsible for related intelligence collection activities within the United States, subject\nto the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended) and other applicable laws, Executive Order 12333\n(as amended), and Attorney General-approved procedures pursuant to that Executive order.\n Acting through the FBI, the Attorney General, in cooperation with other federal departments and\nagencies engaged in activities to protect the national security, shall also coordinate the activities of\nthe other members of the law enforcement community to detect, prevent, preempt, and disrupt\nterrorist attacks against the United States.\n In addition, the Attorney General, generally acting through the FBI Director, has primary\nresponsibility for searching for, finding, and neutralizing weapons of mass destruction within the\nUnited States.\n The Attorney General approves requests submitted by state governors, pursuant to the Emergency\nFederal Law Enforcement Assistance Act, for personnel and other federal law enforcement support\nduring incidents.\n The Attorney General also enforces federal civil rights laws, such as the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Further\ninformation on the Attorney General’s role is provided in the National Prevention Framework and\nPrevention FIOP.\nSecretary of Defense\nThe Secretary of Defense has authority, direction, and control over DoD.29 DoD resources may be\ncommitted when requested by another federal agency and approved by the Secretary of Defense or\nwhen directed by the President. Certain DoD officials and DoD component heads, by statute and/or\nDoD policy, are authorized to approve or delegate the authority to approve certain types of support to\ncivil authorities.30 DoD policy regarding defense support of civil authorities can be found in DoD\nDirective 3025.18, Defense Support to Civil Authorities.31 32 When DoD resources are authorized to\nsupport civil authorities, command of those forces remains with the Secretary of Defense. Under the\ncommand and control of the Secretary of Defense, the operational coordination and employment of\nsuch resources are normally led by the designated Combatant Command (e.g., U.S. Northern\nCommand, Southern Command, or Indo-Pacific Command). DoD elements in the incident area of\noperations coordinate closely with response organizations at all levels.\n29 10 U.S.C. §113.\n30 For example, certain DoD officials may provide an immediate response by temporarily employing the resources\nunder their control, subject to any supplemental direction provided by higher headquarters, to save lives, prevent\nhuman suffering, or mitigate great property damage within the United States in response to a request for assistance\nfrom a civil authority, under imminently serious conditions and, if time does not permit, obtaining approval from a\nhigher authority. Immediate response authority does not permit actions that would subject civilians to the use of\nmilitary power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory (DoD Directive 3025.18). DoD support\nmay also include support provided through mutual or automatic aid agreements, pursuant to Chapter 15A of Title 42\nU.S.C. or pursuant to other statutory authorities or agreements.\n31 For example, DoD Instruction 3025.24, “DoD Public Health and Medical Services in Support of Civil Authorities.”\n32For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has independent statutory authorities regarding emergency\nmanagement, such as Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1941 (Public Law 84-99) (e.g., providing technical\nassistance; direct assistance, such as providing sandbags, pumps, and other types of flood fight materials; emergency\ncontracting; and emergency water assistance due to contaminated water source). Also, the Defense Logistics Agency\nhas an interagency agreement with FEMA to provide commodities, including fuel, to civil authorities responding to\ndisasters.\n36\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nSecretary of State\nA domestic incident may have international and diplomatic implications that call for coordination and\nconsultation with foreign governments and international organizations. The Secretary of State is\nresponsible for all communication and coordination between the U.S. Government and other nations\nregarding the response to a domestic crisis. The Department of State also coordinates international\noffers of assistance and formally accepts or declines these offers on behalf of the U.S. Government,\nbased on needs conveyed by federal departments and agencies, as stated in the International\nCoordination Support Annex. Some types of international assistance are pre-identified, and bilateral\nagreements are already established. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Forest\nService and Department of the Interior have joint bilateral agreements with several countries for\nwildland firefighting support.\nDirector of National Intelligence\nThe Director of National Intelligence serves as the head of the intelligence community, acts as the\nprincipal advisor to the President for intelligence matters relating to national security, and oversees\nand directs implementation of the National Intelligence Program. The intelligence community,\ncomprising 17 elements across the Federal Government, functions consistent with laws, Executive\norders, regulations, and policies to support the national security-related missions of the U.S.\nGovernment. The Director of National Intelligence provides a range of analytic products, including\nthose that assess threats to the homeland and inform planning, capability development, and operational\nactivities of homeland security enterprise partners and stakeholders. In addition to intelligence\ncommunity elements with specific homeland security missions, the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence maintains a number of mission and support centers that provide unique capabilities for\nhomeland security partners.\nEmergency Support Function Roles and Responsibilities\nESFs are not solely attributed to any one organization, nor are they mechanisms for executing an\nagency’s statutory authorities. The federal ESFs bring together the capabilities of federal departments\nand agencies and other national-level assets. Most federal ESFs support a number of the response core\ncapabilities. The core capabilities are delivered to stabilize the community lifelines. Any core\ncapability may be required to help stabilize any community lifeline; therefore, any ESF can contribute\ntoward the stabilization of any community lifeline in coordination with the lead ESF.\nFederal ESFs are groups of organizations that work together to deliver core capabilities to stabilize\ncommunity lifelines in support of an effective response. In addition, there are responsibilities and\nactions associated with federal ESFs that extend beyond the core capabilities and support other\nresponse activities, as well as department and agency responsibilities. While ESFs are primarily a\nfederal coordinating mechanism, states and other organizations or levels of government may adopt the\nconstruct, as well.\nFederal ESF coordinators oversee the preparedness activities for a particular ESF and coordinate\nwith its primary and support agencies. Responsibilities of the ESF coordinator include the following\nduring response:\n Maintaining contact with ESF primary and support agencies through conference calls, meetings,\ntraining activities, and exercises;\n Monitoring the ESF’s progress in delivering the core capabilities in an effort to stabilize the incident;\n Coordinating efforts with corresponding private sector, NGO, and federal partners;\n37\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Ensuring the ESF is engaged in appropriate planning and preparedness activities; and\n Sharing information and coordinating across the spectrum of primary and support agencies.\nESF primary agencies have significant authorities, roles, resources, and capabilities for a particular\nfunction within an ESF. Primary agencies are responsible for the following:\n Orchestrating support and strategy development within their functional area for the appropriate\nresponse core capabilities and other ESF missions;\n Notifying and requesting assistance from support agencies;\n Managing mission assignments (in Stafford Act incidents), and coordinating with support agencies,\nas well as appropriate state officials, operations centers, and other stakeholders;\n Coordinating resources resulting from mission assignments;\n Working with all types of organizations to maximize the use of all available resources;\n Monitoring progress in delivering core capability and other ESF missions, and providing that\ninformation as part of situational and periodic readiness or preparedness assessments;\n Planning for incident management, short-term recovery operations, and transition to long-term\nrecovery support operations;\n Maintaining trained personnel to support interagency emergency response and support teams;\n Identifying new equipment or capabilities required to prevent or respond to new or emerging\nthreats and hazards or to validate and improve capabilities to address changing risks; and\n Promoting physical accessibility, programmatic inclusion, and effective communication for the\nwhole community, including individuals with disabilities.\nESF support agencies have specific capabilities or resources that support primary agencies in\nexecuting the mission of the ESF. The activities of support agencies typically include the following:\n Participating in planning for incident management, short-term recovery operations, transition to\nlong-term recovery support operations, and the development of supporting operational plans,\nstandard operating procedures, checklists, or other job aids;\n Providing input to periodic readiness assessments;\n Maintaining trained personnel to support interagency emergency response and support teams;\n Identifying new equipment or capabilities required to respond to new or emerging threats and\nhazards or to improve the ability to address existing threats; and\n Coordinating resources resulting from response mission assignments.\nTable 4 summarizes the federal ESFs and indicates the response core capabilities each ESF most\ndirectly supports. All ESFs support the common core capabilities—planning, public information and\nwarning, and operational coordination—and many ESFs support more than those listed.\n38\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nTable 4: Emergency Support Functions and ESF Coordinators\nESF #1 – Transportation\nESF Coordinator: Department of Transportation\nCoordinates the support of management of transportation systems and infrastructure, the regulation of\ntransportation, management of the Nation’s airspace, and ensuring the safety and security of the\nnational transportation system.

Focuses particularly on those sectors not currently aligned to other ESFs (e.g., the Financial\nServices Sector). Functions include but are not limited to the following:\n Assessment, analysis, and situational awareness of cross-sector challenges; and\n Facilitates operational coordination with critical infrastructure sectors.\nESF #15 – External Affairs\nESF Coordinator: DHS\nCoordinates the release of accurate, coordinated, timely, and accessible public information to affected\naudiences, including the government, media, NGOs, and the private sector. Works closely with state and\nlocal officials to ensure outreach to the whole community. Functions include but are not limited to the\nfollowing:\n Public affairs and the Joint Information Center;\n Intergovernmental (local, state, tribal, territorial, nongovernmental, and private sector) affairs; and\n Congressional affairs.\n41\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nThe Emergency Support Function Leadership Group (ESFLG) is composed of federal\ndepartments and agencies designated as coordinators for ESFs or coordinating agencies for other\nNRF annexes. The ESFLG provides a forum for departments and agencies with roles in federal\nincident response to jointly address matters pertaining to the community lifelines, emergency\nresponse policy, preparedness, operations, and training. The ESFLG promotes federal unity of effort\nthrough the exchange of information and coordinated decision making during disaster response.\nFEMA leads the ESFLG and is responsible for coordinating steady-state and operational activities.\nOther Federal Department and Agency Heads\nThe heads of all federal departments and agencies provide their full and prompt cooperation, resources,\nand support, as appropriate and consistent with their own responsibilities, for protecting the national\nsecurity. Various federal departments or agencies play primary, coordinating, or support roles in\ndelivering response core capabilities. In some circumstances, other federal agencies may have a lead\nor support role in coordinating operations or elements of operations, consistent with applicable legal\nauthorities. Nothing in the NRF precludes a federal department or agency from executing its existing\nauthorities. For all incidents, federal department and agency heads serve as advisors for the executive\nbranch relative to their areas of responsibility.\nFederal departments and agencies designated as coordinating and cooperating agencies in NRF support\nannexes conduct a variety of activities, to include managing specific functions and missions and\nproviding federal support within their functional areas.\nFederal Authorities\nFederal assistance can be provided to local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area jurisdictions, as\nwell as to other federal departments and agencies, through several different mechanisms and\nauthorities. Federal financial assistance may also be available for disability-related access and\nfunctional needs equipment.\n42\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nDifferent federal departments or agencies lead coordination of the Federal Government’s response\nactions, depending on their express and implied statutory authorities and based on the type and\nmagnitude of the incident. Federal departments or agencies are supported by other agencies who bring\nrelevant capabilities that support those affected by the incident. Figure 5 shows the authorities for\ncoordination of federal response support described in the following sections.\nFigure 5: Incident Management and Response Authorities for the Federal Government\nFederal Response and Assistance Under the Robert T. Stafford\nDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act\nThe Federal Government may provide assistance in the form of funding, resources, and services.\nFederal departments and agencies respect the sovereignty and responsibilities of local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, and insular area governments, while rendering assistance that supports the affected local,\nstate, tribal, territorial, and insular governments.\n43\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nLocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments do not require federal assistance to respond\nto most incidents; however, when an incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response\nis beyond the capabilities of the local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments, the\ngovernor or chief executive of a tribe can request federal assistance under the Stafford Act. In certain\ncircumstances, the President may declare an emergency without a request from a governor when the\nprimary responsibility for response rests with the United States because the emergency involves a\nsubject area for which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the United States exercises\nexclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority.\nThe Stafford Act authorizes the President to provide financial and other assistance to local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, and insular area governments; certain private nonprofit organizations; and individuals to\nsupport response, recovery, and mitigation efforts following a Stafford Act emergency or major\ndisaster declaration.33 Most forms of Stafford Act assistance require a cost share. While federal\nassistance under the Stafford Act may only be delivered after a declaration, FEMA may pre-deploy\nfederal assets when a declaration is likely and imminent. The Stafford Act provides for two types of\ndeclarations:\n An emergency declaration is more limited in scope than a major disaster declaration, involves\nfewer federal programs, and is not normally associated with recovery programs. However, the\nPresident may issue an emergency declaration prior to an actual incident to lessen or avert the\nthreat of a catastrophe. Generally, federal assistance and funding are provided to meet specific\nemergency needs or to help prevent a catastrophe from occurring.\n A major disaster declaration provides more federal programs for response and recovery than an\nemergency declaration. Unlike an emergency declaration, a major disaster declaration may only be\nissued after an incident.\nFederal Departments and Agencies Acting Under Their Own\nAuthorities\nImmediate life-saving assistance to states, tribes, territories, and insular areas, as well as other types of\nassistance, such as wildland firefighting support or response to an agricultural disease or significant\ncyber incident, are performed by federal departments or agencies under their own authorities and\nfunding or through reciprocal mutual assistance agreements. Some federal departments or agencies\nhave authorities to declare specific types of disasters or emergencies and conduct or lead federal\nresponse actions using funding sources other than the Disaster Relief Fund. For example, specific trust\nfunds are established under federal environmental laws to support and fund oil and hazardous\nsubstances response operations. Similarly, federal land management agencies are required at all times\nto respond to incidents of all magnitudes that occur on or impact federal lands managed by those\nagencies, while federal departments and agencies acting under the trust doctrine can provide financial\nand programmatic support to tribes, when requested.\nWhen the Secretary of Homeland Security is not coordinating the overall response, federal departments\nand agencies may coordinate federal operations under their own statutory authorities or as designated\nby the President and may activate response structures applicable to those authorities. The head of the\ndepartment or agency may also request the Secretary of Homeland Security to activate NRF structures\nand elements (e.g. Incident Management Assistance Teams and National Operation Center elements)\nto provide additional assistance, while still retaining leadership for the response.\n33 These authorities may be exercised independently of, concurrently with, or become part of a federal response\ncoordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to Presidential directive.\n44\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFederal departments and agencies carry out their response authorities and responsibilities within the\nNRF’s overarching construct or under supplementary or complementary operational plans. Table 5\nprovides examples of scenarios in which specific federal departments and agencies have the\nresponsibility for coordinating response activities. This is not an all-inclusive list; incident annexes\ncontained in FIOPs provide greater operational detail for these and other incidents.\nTable 5: Examples of Other Federal Department and Agency Authorities34\nScenario Department/Agency Authorities\nThe Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to declare an\nextraordinary emergency and take action because of the\npresence of a pest or disease of livestock that threatens\nAgricultural livestock in the United States. (7 U.S.C. § 8306 [2007]). The\nand Food USDA Secretary of Agriculture also has the authority to declare an\nIncident extraordinary emergency and take action because of the\npresence of a plant pest or noxious weed whose presence\nthreatens plants or plant products of the United States.\n(7 U.S.C. § 7715 [2007]).\nThe Secretary of the Department of Health and Human\nServices has the authority to take actions to protect the public\nhealth and welfare, declare a public health emergency, and\nto prepare for and respond to public health emergencies\n(Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq.).\nThe Public Health Service Act (PHSA), as amended by the\nPublic Health Department of Health Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act,\nand Medical and Human Services Public Law No. 113-5, forms the foundation of HHS legal\nIncident35 (HHS) authority for responding to public health emergencies (Public\nHealth Service Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq.). The Project\nBioShield Act amended the PHSA to provide flexible authorities\nto expedite and enhance research, development, procurement,\nand stockpiling of medical countermeasures for a biological\nincident (Public Law 108-276 (as amended at 21 U.S.C. §\n360bbb-3; 42 U.S.C. §§ 247d-6a, 247d-6b).\nThe EPA and USCG have the authority to take actions to\nrespond to oil discharges and releases of hazardous\nEnvironmental substances, pollutants, and contaminants, including leading\nOil and\nProtection Agency the response. (42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., 33 U.S.C. § 1251\nHazardous\n(EPA) or U.S. Coast et seq.). The EPA Administrator and Commandant of the\nMaterials Spills\nGuard (USCG) USCG36 may also classify an oil discharge as a spill of\nnational significance and designate senior officials to\nparticipate in the response. (40 CFR Part 300.323).37\nCyber Incident FBI, Office of the The FBI has the designation of federal lead agency for\n34 These and other department or agency authorities may be exercised independently of, concurrently with, or become\npart of a federal response coordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to Presidential directive. Other\ndepartment and agency authorities for specific incidents can be found in the FIOP’s incident annexes.\n35 A declaration of a public health emergency may make available any funds appropriated to the Public Health\nEmergency Fund.\n36 The Commandant of the USCG coordinates the designation of a spill of national significance with the Secretary of\nHomeland Security, as appropriate.\n37 See ESF #10 – Oil and Hazardous Materials Response Annex for more information on these authorities.\n45\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nScenario Department/Agency Authorities\nDirector of National threat response activities (PPD-41). Threat response\nIntelligence (ODNI), activities include the law enforcement and national security\nand DHS/CISA investigation of a cyber incident, including collecting\nevidence, linking related incidents, gathering intelligence,\nidentifying opportunities for threat pursuit and disruption,\nand providing attribution. ODNI, through the Cyber Threat\nintelligence Integration Center, is the lead federal agency for\nintelligence support and related activities. DHS has the\nresponsibility for asset response activities, such as\nproviding technical assets and assistance to mitigate\nvulnerabilities and reducing the impact of the incident,\nidentifying and assessing the risk posed to other entities and\nmitigating those risks, and providing guidance on how to\nleverage federal resources and capabilities (PPD-41). The\nCyber UCG will also include relevant sector-specific\nagencies if a cyber incident affects or is likely to affect the\nsectors they represent. FEMA maintains the responsibility\nfor coordinating consequence management for physical\nimpacts to the population.\nWhen a federal department or agency has responsibility for directing or managing a major aspect of a\nresponse coordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, that organization is part of the national\nleadership for the incident and is represented in field, regional, and headquarters unified command and\ncoordination organizations.\nFederal-to-Federal Support\nFederal departments and agencies may execute interagency or intra-agency reimbursable agreements\nin accordance with the Economy Act or other applicable authorities. The Financial Management\nSupport Annex to the NRF contains information about this process. A federal department or agency\nresponding to an incident under its own authorities may also request support from the Secretary of\nHomeland Security in obtaining and coordinating additional federal assistance. The Secretary of\nHomeland Security may activate one or more ESFs to provide the requested support.\nInternational Support\nFEMA, the Department of State, and other Federal agencies use the International Assistance Systems\nConcept of Operations to manage the acceptance or request of international resources following a\nStafford Act declaration. The Federal Government may execute a process to “pull” resources from\ninternational partners where the assistance meets known requirements identified by the local, state,\ntribal, territorial, insular or Federal officials in the disaster area based on a request from an authorized\nFederal response agency for resources that are urgently needed but not available in the United States.\nThe Federal Government may operate a “push” process when accepting the assistance that addresses\nFederal Government diplomatic interests even when foreign assistance has not been requested. The\nFederal Government only accepts commodities that can enter the country without significant regulatory\nagency oversight or inspection and that can readily be used. FEMA coordinates through the ESFs and\nwith regulatory agencies to ensure assets are appropriate to be applied to the disaster and meet statutory\nor regulatory requirements.\n46\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFederal Response and Assistance Available Without a Stafford Act\nDeclaration\nThe NRF covers the full range of complex and constantly changing requirements in anticipation of or\nin response to threats or actual incidents. In addition to Stafford Act support, the NRF or other\nsupplementary or complementary operational plans may be applied to respond or provide other forms\nof support. During a non-Stafford Act response:\n The President may designate, and departments and agencies may recommend through the\ninteragency policy process, an LFA to manage the incident.\n When an LFA is designated, the LFA appoints a senior response official to carry out its\nresponsibilities employing the NRF, NDRF, and NIMS. The senior response official is the Federal\nGovernment’s senior representative fully dedicated to the response, demonstrates national-level\nleadership in a time of crisis, and acts as the face and voice of the Federal response when interacting\nwith other senior Federal, state, tribal, territorial, or insular, private sector, nongovernmental, and\nelected officials as well as the media and the public.\n When directed by the President or requested by an agency head, FEMA’s incident management\ncapabilities may be used on a reimbursable basis under the Economy Act to support an LFA in\ncarrying out the aforementioned responsibilities. FEMA may adjust the scale of its support to\nensure execution of its statutory responsibilities.\nOperational Planning\nOperational planning is conducted across the whole community, including the private sector, NGOs,\nand all levels of government. Operational planning is guided by objectives and priorities identified in\nrelated strategic plans and an understanding of the risks that affect an organization or jurisdiction. The\nNRF fosters unity of effort for emergency operations planning by providing common doctrine and\npurpose, which integrates both the National Preparedness System and the National Planning System.\nPlanning is fundamental to national preparedness. Plans are a continuous, evolving instrument of\nanticipated actions that maximize opportunities and guide response operations. Because planning is an\nongoing process, a plan is a product based on information and understanding at the moment and is\nsubject to revision.\nThe National Planning System provides a unified approach and common terminology for deliberate\nand incident action planning. Deliberate planning involves developing strategic, operational, and\ntactical plans to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from a\njurisdiction’s threats or hazards. Incident action planning, sometimes referred to as crisis action\nplanning, occurs in a time-constrained environment to develop or rapidly adapt operational and tactical\nplans in response to an imminent or ongoing incident.38\nDeliberate plans provide the starting point for incident response and recovery and provide much of the\nrequired information for incident action planning, which is then adapted to meet operational conditions.\nThe planning process includes a feedback loop for continual refinement of deliberate and incident plans\nto more effectively address incident priorities and objectives. Incident plans are continually refined\n38 National Planning System, 2016, pages 4 and 5.\n47\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nthroughout an incident, based on emerging operational conditions. Incident plans can also support the\nmodification and improvement of deliberate plans through after-action and lessons-learned processes.\nResponse to emergencies and disasters will be most effective when communities conduct risk- and\ncapability-based planning. Support provided by the National Risk Management Center and tools such\nas the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment, Stakeholder Preparedness Review, and\nCore Capability Development Sheets help communities to set risk-based capability targets, evaluate\ncapability gaps, and develop strategies to build and sustain discrete capabilities. These activities inform\nresource investment and allocation, drive deliberate planning efforts focused on the most challenging\nrisks, and help government and private sector officials understand response and recovery capacities\nand identify where mutual aid or other assistance may fill capability gaps.\nThe National Planning System and Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 provide further\ninformation on the various types of plans and guidance on the fundamentals of planning.\nFederal Planning\nFederal planning is integrated to align, link, and synchronize response actions to enable federal\ndepartments and agencies and other national-level partners to provide the right resources at the right\ntime to support local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area government response operations.\nIntegrated planning provides answers for which traditional and nontraditional partners can deliver\ncapabilities that stabilize community lifelines and ultimately support the recovery of the community.\nThe NRF is based on the concept of tiered response with an understanding that most incidents start at\nthe local or tribal level, and as needs exceed resources and capabilities, additional local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, insular area, or federal assets may be required. The FIOP for response and recovery,\ntherefore, is intended to align with other local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area government, and\nfederal plans to ensure that all response partners share a common operational focus. Similarly,\nintegration occurs at the federal level among the departments, agencies, and nongovernmental partners\nthat compose the respective mission area through the frameworks, FIOPs, and departmental and agency\noperations plans.\nFigure 6 provides an overview of how federal deliberate planning efforts are aligned under the National\nPreparedness System and are mutually supportive in their development, coordination, and use.\nSimilarly, complementary and mutually supportive plans may be developed by organizations through\nincident action planning.\n48\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFigure 6: Alignment of Planning Efforts with PPD 8 – National Preparedness\nApplication for Planning\nImplementation of the concepts within the NRF and related FIOP are mandatory for federal\ndepartments and agencies. While the NRF does not direct the actions of other response elements, the\nguidance contained in the NRF and the FIOP is intended to inform local, state, tribal, territorial, and\ninsular area governments, as well as NGOs and the private sector, regarding how the Federal\nGovernment responds to incidents. These partners can use this information to inform their planning\nand ensure that assumptions regarding federal assistance and response and the manner in which federal\nsupport will be provided are accurate.\nAt the federal level, the NRF is supported by the FIOP. Incident annexes to the FIOP address unique\nconcepts of operations or capabilities for risks not otherwise addressed by the FIOP. The concepts in\nthe NRF and NIMS guide federal operational response planning and the FIOP, which provides further\ninformation regarding roles and responsibilities and identifies the critical tasks, resourcing, and\nsourcing requirements. The NRF does not contain detailed descriptions of specific department or\nagency functions because such information is located in department- or agency-level operational plans.\nFederal department and agency plans should, at a minimum, address the execution of their roles and\nresponsibilities in support of the NRF and FIOP to deliver the core capabilities.\n49\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nContinuity Considerations\nNational preparedness and sustainment of essential functions are a shared responsibility of the whole\ncommunity. Continuity considerations should be incorporated into the planning process. Continuity is\nnot strictly a governmental responsibility, nor is it limited to a specific critical infrastructure sector.\nEffective continuity planning helps to ensure the uninterrupted ability to engage partners; to respond\nappropriately with scaled, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities; to specify succession to\noffice and delegations of authority to protect the unity of effort and command; and to account for the\navailability of responders, regardless of the threat or hazard.39\nEnsuring the continuity of community lifeline operations is a critical part of responding to a disaster.\nContinuity planning and operations increase the likelihood of uninterrupted coordination across\njurisdictions, levels of government, and the private sector, particularly during catastrophic incidents.\nFor example, effective response operations require the operability, interoperability, and continuity of\ncommunications. The National Emergency Communications Plan provides the whole community with\na strategic plan that establishes a shared vision for and coordinates the complex mission of maintaining\nand improving emergency communications capabilities.\nContinuity considerations, including community lifeline interdependencies, should be built into all\nplans and guidance and supported by leadership at all levels. Without the implementation of continuity\nprinciples, private sector organizations and governments at all levels may be unable to provide services\nand sustainment of community lifelines when needed the most.\nSupporting Resources\nTo assist NRF users, FEMA maintains electronic versions of the current NRF documents—the base\ndocument, ESF annexes, and support annexes—as well as other supporting materials. FEMA also\nprovides information, training materials, and other tools, such as an overview of the main Stafford Act\nprovisions, a guide to authorities and references, and an abbreviations list to assist response partners\nin understanding and executing their roles under the NRF. Materials are regularly evaluated, updated,\nand augmented, as necessary. Additional content may be added or modified at the request of response\nmission area partners and other users.\nMaintenance\nThe NRF is a living document, and it will be regularly reviewed to evaluate consistency with existing\nand new policies, evolving conditions, and the experience gained from its use. Reviews will be\nconducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the NRF on a quadrennial basis.\nDHS will coordinate and oversee the review and maintenance process for the NRF. The revision\nprocess includes developing or updating documents necessary to carry out capabilities. Significant\nupdates to the NRF will be vetted through a federal senior-level interagency review process. The NRF\nwill be reviewed in order to accomplish the following:\n Assess and update information on the core capabilities in support of response goals and objectives;\n Ensure that the NRF adequately reflects the organization of responsible entities;\n Ensure that the NRF is consistent with the other four mission areas;\n Update processes based on changes in the national threat/hazard environment;\n39 For more information on continuity considerations, see https://www.fema.gov/continuity-guidance-circular-cgc.\n50\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Incorporate lessons-learned and effective practices from day-to-day operations, exercises, and\nactual incidents and alerts; and\n Reflect progress in the Nation’s response mission activities the need to execute new laws,\nExecutive orders, and Presidential directives, as well as strategic changes to national priorities and\nguidance, critical tasks, or national capabilities.\nIn reviewing the implementation of the NRF, FEMA will consider effective practices and lessons-\nlearned from exercises and operations, as well as pertinent new processes and technologies. Effective\npractices include continuity planning, which ensures that the capabilities contained in the NRF can\ncontinue to be executed, regardless of the threat or hazard. Pertinent new processes and technologies\nshould enable the Nation to adapt efficiently to the evolving risk environment and use data relating to\nlocation, context, and interdependencies that allow for effective integration across all missions using a\nstandards-based approach. Updates to the NRF annexes may occur independently from reviews of the\nbase document.\nConclusion\nIn implementing the NRF to build national preparedness and resilience, partners are encouraged to\ndevelop a shared understanding of broad-level strategic implications as they make critical decisions in\nbuilding future capacity and capability. The whole community should be engaged in examining and\nimplementing the strategy and doctrine contained in the NRF, considering current and future\nrequirements in the process.\nThe whole community remains firm in its commitment to safeguard itself against its greatest risks, now\nand in the future. Through whole community engagement, the Nation will continue to improve its\npreparedness to face all emergencies or disaster challenges that may unfold.\n51",

      "text": "National Response Framework\nExecutive Summary\nThe National Response Framework (NRF) provides foundational emergency management doctrine for\nhow the Nation responds to all types of incidents. The NRF is built on scalable, flexible, and adaptable\nconcepts identified in the National Incident Management System (NIMS) to align key roles and\nresponsibilities across the Nation. The structures, roles, and responsibilities described in this\nFramework can be partially or fully implemented in the context of a threat or hazard, in anticipation of\na significant event, or in response to an incident. Implementation of the structures and procedures\ndescribed herein allows for a scaled response, delivery of specific resources and capabilities, and a\nlevel of coordination appropriate to each incident.\nResponding to disasters and emergencies requires the cooperation of a variety of organizations; the\nlarger or more complex the incident, the greater the number and variety of organizations that must\nrespond. Think of a residential fire: Firefighters are leading the charge; public works may be on scene\nproviding traffic control; police are providing security; emergency medical services personnel are\ntriaging, transporting, and redistributing injured to local hospitals; and a local nonprofit or voluntary\norganization (e.g., American Red Cross and Salvation Army) may be on hand to assist displaced\nresidents. For large disasters, such as major hurricanes or earthquakes, the incident complexity is\nincreased as others—such as states or tribes and, ultimately, the Federal Government—become\ninvolved. Businesses, voluntary organizations, and other elements of the private sector are also key\nstakeholders, providing the essential services that must be restored following an incident. The NRF\nprovides the foundation for how these organizations coordinate, integrate, and unify their response.\nThe unprecedented scale of recent disasters has spurred continued innovation in response operations\nand highlighted the need for further progress to build resilient capabilities to respond to disasters of\nincreasing frequency and magnitude. This fourth edition of the NRF embraces lessons-learned from\nthose disasters and shares emerging best practices.\nSince publication of the third edition of the NRF in 2016, disaster response operations have\nunderscored the paramount importance of sustaining essential community lifelines. The Framework\ndefines community lifelines as those services that enable the continuous operation of critical\ngovernment and business functions and are essential to human health and safety or economic security.\nIf disrupted, rapid stabilization of community lifelines is essential to restoring a sense of normalcy.\nRecent disasters have illuminated two underlying features of community lifelines that highlight\nopportunities to strengthen response planning and operations.\nFirst, community lifelines are interdependent and vulnerable to cascading failures. For example,\ncommunications and electric power systems rely on each other to function; severe damage to one will\ndisrupt the other. Most lifelines also rely on complex supply chains. Water and wastewater service\ndepend on the resupply of a broad array of chemicals and—if power goes out—fuel for emergency\ngenerators. However, in a severe natural or human-caused incident, those supply chains themselves\nmay be broken.\nSecond, community lifeline stabilization relies on businesses and infrastructure owners and operators\nwho have the expertise and primary responsibility for managing their systems in emergencies.\nAccordingly, new doctrine and coordination mechanisms are needed to enable the private sector to\nplay a larger, more comprehensive role in preparedness and response activities.\nThe NRF is structured to help jurisdictions, citizens, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and\nbusinesses develop whole community plans, integrate continuity plans, and build capabilities to\nrespond to cascading failures among businesses, supply chains, and infrastructure sectors, as well as\ncollaborate with the private sector and NGOs to stabilize community lifelines and enable restoration\nii"

Critical infrastructure sector leadership (sector-specific agencies,\ngovernment coordinating councils, and sector coordinating councils) create an established network to\ncollaborate with their respective private sector partners and support cross-sector1 response operations.\nOften, Emergency Support Functions (ESF) work with sector leadership to bolster preparedness for\ncross-sector collaboration. This fourth edition of the NRF describes new initiatives that leverage\nexisting networks and better integrate business interests and infrastructure owners and operators into\nthe heart of emergency management.\nThe NRF describes ways to improve coordination and response structures to build preparedness for\ncatastrophic incidents. Stabilizing community lifelines in catastrophic incidents is vital and\nextraordinarily difficult. Communities cannot meet these challenges solely by scaling up existing plans\nand capabilities. Rather, new mechanisms are needed to supplement and integrate those already in\nplace and facilitate cross-sector coordination, while respecting the roles of private sector partners and\nauthorities of agencies at all levels of government.\nA new ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure is introduced to focus on engaging private\nsector interests and infrastructure owners and operators—particularly those in sectors not currently\naligned to other ESFs—and conducting cross-sector analysis to help inform decision making. ESF #14\nrelies on other ESFs aligned with a critical infrastructure sector to continue coordination with their\ncorresponding sector during response efforts. ESF #14 helps coordinate multi-sector response\noperations between (or across) the government and private sector for natural or human-caused\ncatastrophic incidents that jeopardize national public health and safety, the economy, and national\nsecurity.\nThis edition of the Framework also builds on the response approach in previous editions to address\nnational security emergencies. The National Security Strategy of the United States of America notes\nthat potential adversaries are developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten U.S.\ncritical infrastructure.2 Adversaries may also strategically target attacks to exploit interdependencies\nbetween infrastructure sectors and magnify cascading failures between them, posing incident response\nchallenges above and beyond those created by earthquakes or other catastrophic natural hazards. The\ninitiatives in this Framework address the resulting challenges for consequence management in ways\nthat supplement and support other government, private sector, and NGO plans and coordinating\nstructures.\n1 Cross-sector operations are those actions taken by public and private sector organizations from one or more of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors to help entities or facilities associated with other sectors respond to an incident, being\nfocused on preventing or mitigating cascading failures between sectors and restoring critical supply chains.\n2 For more information on the National Security Strategy of the United States of America, see\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf.\niii"

      "text": "National Response Framework\nIntroduction\nThe National Preparedness System outlines an organized process for the whole community3 to move\nforward with its preparedness activities and achieve the National Preparedness Goal. The National\nResponse Framework (NRF) sets the strategy and doctrine for how the whole community builds,\nsustains, and delivers the response core capabilities identified in the National Preparedness Goal in an\nintegrated manner with the other mission areas. The fourth edition of the NRF emphasizes enhancing\nthe unity of effort between the government and the private sector through better coordination and\ncollaboration.\nEvolution of the Framework\nThe NRF builds on over 25 years of federal response guidance, beginning with the Federal Response\nPlan, published in 1992, and the National Response Plan, published in 2004. This fourth edition of the\nNRF reorganizes and streamlines the previous version of the NRF, expands principles and\nconcepts to better integrate government and private sector response efforts, and introduces the\ncommunity lifelines concept and terminology.\nThis document supersedes the National Response Framework, Third Edition that was\nissued in June 2016 and becomes effective 60 days after publication.\nCommunity lifelines are those services that enable the continuous operation of critical government and\nbusiness functions and are essential to human health and safety or economic security. In serious but\npurely local incidents, interruptions of water service, electric power, and other community lifeline\ncomponents are typically brief and easy to mitigate. However, severe and widespread incidents can\nhalt lifeline services for many weeks or months. Such disruptions are especially extensive in\ncatastrophic incidents and may result in mass casualties and other cascading consequences.\nMaking community lifelines a core focus of incident response within the NRF offers unique benefits\nfor incidents ranging from small-scale to catastrophic disasters. By building capabilities to stabilize4\nand accelerate the restoration of community lifeline services, it will be possible to save countless lives,\nlimit damage to the economy, help maintain essential services for critical national security installations,\nreduce the initial impacts of disasters, and facilitate recovery operations. While the primary focus of\nincident response remains on stabilizing community lifelines, other secondary considerations regarding\nthe natural and cultural environment and economic factors are equally as important.\n3 Whole community includes individuals and communities, businesses, private and public sector owners and operators\nof critical infrastructure, faith-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, and all levels of government (local,\nregional/metropolitan, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal). Whole community is defined in the National\nPreparedness Goal as “a focus on enabling the participation in national preparedness activities of a wider range of\nplayers from the private sector, including nongovernmental organizations and the general public, in conjunction with\nthe participation of all levels of governmental in order to foster better coordination and working relationships.”\n4 Stabilization occurs when immediate threats to life and property are anticipated, resourced, and managed and basic\ncommunity lifeline services are provided to survivors.\n1"

      "text": "National Response Framework\nCommunity lifelines provide a valuable decision-making construct to integrate cross-sector5 response\noperations and reporting. Each lifeline depends on multiple infrastructure sectors, businesses, and\nsupply chains to function. Focusing on community lifelines allows emergency managers and their\npartners to account for these complex interdependencies and prioritize response operations to achieve\nhigh-impact, multi-sector benefits. The Framework describes how the resources and capabilities of the\nFederal Government support such operations, while the new Emergency Support Function (ESF) #14\n– Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex describes how it facilitates coordination and\ncollaboration with business and infrastructure owners and operators to provide assistance and integrate\nthe private sector's support during response, particularly for those sectors not currently aligned to other\nESFs. Additional detail on the community lifelines can be found in the Prioritized Stabilization of\nCommunity Lifelines section.\nFinally, the Framework’s focus on community lifelines necessitates deeper collaboration with the\nprivate sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGO). During the disasters of 2017 and 2018,\nindividual businesses and infrastructure owners and operators (including public and private sectors)\nforged innovative, collaborative relationships with government agencies to help prioritize and\naccelerate the stabilization of community lifeline services. The fourth edition of the NRF and ESF #14\n– Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex institutionalize their progress and build upon it in\nways that respect the authorities, responsibilities, and roles of all public, private, and NGO partners\nessential to incident response.\nFramework Purpose and Organization\nThe NRF is a guide to how the Nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies. The NRF is\nbuilt on scalable, flexible, and adaptable concepts identified in the National Incident Management\nSystem (NIMS) to align key roles and responsibilities across the Nation. The NRF describes specific\nauthorities and best practices for managing incidents that range from the serious but purely local to\nthose that are catastrophic and national in scope.\nWithin the NRF, the term “response” includes actions to save lives, protect property and the\nenvironment, stabilize the incident, and meet basic human needs following an incident. Response also\nincludes the execution of emergency plans and actions to enable recovery. The NRF describes doctrine\nfor managing all types of disasters or emergencies, regardless of scale, scope, and complexity. The\ngoals and objectives herein explain common response disciplines and processes that have been\ndeveloped at all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area,6 and federal) and have\nmatured over time.\nTo achieve the National Preparedness Goal, the objectives of the NRF are to do the following:\n Describe coordinating structures, as well as key roles and responsibilities for integrating\ncapabilities across the whole community, to support the efforts of governments, the private sector,\nand NGOs in responding to actual and potential incidents;\n Describe how unity of effort among public and private sectors, as well as NGOs, supports the\nstabilization of community lifelines and prioritized restoration of infrastructure during an incident\n5 Cross-sector operations are those actions taken by public and private sector organizations from one or more of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors to help entities or facilities associated with other sectors respond to an incident,\nfocused on preventing or mitigating cascading failures between sectors and restoring critical supply chains. These\noperations include measures taken by infrastructure owners and operators, businesses, and their government partners\nto account for cross-sector interdependencies in incident response operations.\n6 Per the Stafford Act, insular areas include Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Other statutes or departments and agencies may define the term “insular area” differently.\n2"

The NRF is\nstructured to help achieve these goals by establishing a new federal ESF coordinating structure to help\nmitigate the impact of catastrophic incidents on community lifelines and account for the risk that\nadversaries will seek to complicate and disrupt U.S. response operations.\nThe NRF is composed of a base document, ESF annexes, and support annexes. The annexes provide\ndetailed information to assist with the implementation of the NRF.\n ESF annexes describe the federal coordinating structures that group resources and capabilities into\nfunctional areas most frequently needed in a national response.\n Support annexes describe other mechanisms by which support is organized among private sector,\nNGO, and federal partners. The support annexes describe the essential supporting processes and\nconsiderations common to most incidents. Content found within the support annexes is superseded\nby changes and updates to legislation. The support annexes include the following:\n− Financial management\n− International coordination\n− Public affairs\n− Tribal relations\n− Volunteer and donations management\n− Worker safety and health\nThe Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Support Annex and Private Sector Coordination Support\nAnnex, which supplemented previous versions of the NRF, have been superseded in this fourth edition\nof the NRF by ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex, which has been added as\npart of this updated framework. All references to these support annexes within the ESF or support\nannexes should be read as referring to the ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure.\nScope\nThe NRF is a framework for all types of threats and hazards, ranging from accidents, technological\nhazards, natural disasters, and human-caused incidents. This Framework is utilized to implement\nNIMS and describes whole community coordinating structures and response activities; in particular,\nthe Framework outlines government, private sector, and nongovernmental roles to reinforce\n3"

The\nNRF is applicable to all federal, local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area departments and agencies\nthat participate in operations requiring a coordinated federal response.\nNRF elements can be implemented at any time for any hazard, including the employment of ESF\nmechanisms. The structures, roles, and responsibilities described herein can be partially or fully\nimplemented in the context of a threat or hazard, in anticipation of a significant event, or in response\nto an incident. Implementation of NRF structures and procedures allows for a scaled response, delivery\nof the specific resources and capabilities, and a level of coordination appropriate to each incident.\nThe response mission area includes the capabilities necessary to stabilize an incident, save lives, protect\nproperty and the environment, meet basic human needs, restore community lifeline services and other\nbasic community functionality, and establish a safe and secure environment to facilitate the integration\nof recovery activities.\nIn this fourth edition of the NRF, the thresholds for catastrophic incident response may vary depending\non one’s perspective. A localized flood can be catastrophic to an individual family who lost their home\nand possessions, a severe tornado can be catastrophic to a town or city, and a hurricane can be\ncatastrophic to a state or territory. At the national level, a catastrophic incident8 is one of such extreme\nand remarkable severity or magnitude that the Nation’s collective capability to manage all response\nrequirements would be overwhelmed, thereby posing potential threats to national security, national\neconomic security, and/or the public health and safety of the Nation. A national catastrophic incident\nimplies that the necessary resources are not available within expected timeframes for incident response.\nDuring a national catastrophic incident, decision makers would be forced to consider the landscape of\nrequirements and prioritize resources to manage shortfalls rather than to address all needs at once. Such\na situation would also require the extraordinary means of mobilizing and prioritizing national resources\nto alleviate human suffering; protect lives and property; reduce damage to natural, cultural, and historic\nresources; stabilize the Nation’s economy; and ensure national security.\nIn this Framework, the term “incident” includes any occurrence, natural or manmade, that necessitates\na response to protect life or property and includes planned events, as well as emergencies or disasters\nof all kinds and sizes. The NRF’s structures and procedures address how federal departments and\nagencies coordinate support for local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments and how\ngovernment at all levels works in unity with private sector and NGOs.\nNothing in the NRF is intended to alter or impede the ability of a local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea government or Federal Government department or agency to carry out its authorities or meet its\nresponsibilities under applicable laws, Executive orders, and directives.\n7 The NRF must be consistent with all pertinent statutes and policies, particularly those involving privacy and civil\nand human rights, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Civil\nRights Act of 1964.\n8 The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 defines the term “catastrophic incident” as “any\nnatural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage\nor disruption severely affecting the population (including mass evacuations), infrastructure, environment, economy,\nnational morale, or government functions in an area.”\n4"

The private sector includes for-profit and nonprofit organizations, formal and informal\nstructures, commerce, and industries that comprise the national economy and are not part of a\ngovernment structure. NGOs are a distinct category of organizations within the private sector that can\ninclude voluntary, ethnic, faith-based, veteran-based, disability,9 relief agency, and animal welfare\norganizations, among others, and are referenced separately. This all-inclusive whole community\napproach focuses efforts and enables a full range of stakeholders to participate in national preparedness\nactivities and to be full partners in incident response, including emergency management practitioners,\nfirst responders, and community leaders.\nInfrastructure owners and operators (in private and public sectors), and other elements of the private\nsector, are especially important partners for incident response and a key audience for the Framework.\nThese partners are vital for strengthening the coordination between industry and government that is\nnecessary to stabilize community lifelines after major incidents or events. They are also crucial partners\nfor creating the plans and doctrine to support essential functions for cross-sector response operations,\nespecially where their ability to volunteer capabilities and expertise provides vital (and in some cases\nirreplaceable) contributions to protecting public health and safety. Moreover, because catastrophic\nincidents will create far more requests for emergency resources and types of government assistance\nthan can be immediately fulfilled, infrastructure owners and operators and other commercial interests\ncan help government agencies establish objective, nationwide criteria to help inform the allocation of\nscarce resources to promote stabilization efforts, restore infrastructure, and to reduce morbidity and\nmortality.\nThe fourth edition of the NRF describes how the whole community contributes to and benefits from\nnational preparedness and integrated incident response. This includes children;10 older adults;\nindividuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs;11 those from religious, racial,\nand ethnically diverse backgrounds; people with limited English proficiency; and owners of animals,\nincluding household pets and service and assistance animals. Their individual contributions and needs\nmust be incorporated into response planning and delivery of the core capabilities. For further\ninformation, see the Core Capabilities section.\nGuiding Principles\nThe following principles establish fundamental doctrine for the response mission area to support\nlocally executed, state managed, and federally supported disaster operations: (1) engaged partnership;\n(2) tiered response; (3) scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities; (4) unity of effort\n9 An individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities (an\n“actual disability”) or a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity (“record\nof”) or an actual or perceived impairment, whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life\nactivity that is not both transitory and minor (“regarded as”). Individuals with disabilities have civil rights protections\nthat may not be waived under any circumstances, including throughout emergencies and disasters.\n10 Children require a unique set of considerations across the core capabilities contained within this document. Their\nneeds must be taken into consideration as part of any integrated planning effort.\n11 Access and functional needs refer to persons who may have additional needs before, during, and after an incident\nin functional areas, including but not limited to maintaining health, independence, communication, transportation,\nsupport, services, self-determination, and medical care. Individuals in need of additional response assistance may\ninclude those who have disabilities, live in institutionalized settings, are older adults, are children, are from diverse\ncultures, have limited English proficiency or are non-English speaking, or are transportation disadvantaged.\n5"

These principles are rooted in the federal system\nand the U.S. Constitution’s division of responsibilities between federal and state governments. These\nprinciples reflect the history of emergency management and the distilled wisdom of responders and\nleaders across the whole community.\nEngaged Partnership\nLocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments understand their needs best and play a\ncritical role in involving the whole community in preparing for and responding to disasters in order to\nmanage risk to communities and infrastructure.\nThose who lead emergency response efforts must communicate and support engagement with the\nwhole community by developing shared goals and aligning capabilities to reduce the scope and\nduration of impacts to any jurisdiction in times of crisis. Layered, mutually supporting capabilities of\nindividuals, communities, the private sector, NGOs, and governments at all levels allow for\ncoordinated planning in times of calm and effective response in times of crisis. Engaged partnership\nand coalition building include ongoing clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically\nappropriate communication to ensure an appropriate response. 12\nPartnership engagement entails continuous adaptation and improvements for incident preparedness and\ncontinuity of operations against all types of threats and hazards. The spectrum of viable threats is\nexpanding. Most notably, cyber threats to the Nation’s critical infrastructure and the community\nlifelines are intensifying. New challenges for incident response are also emerging. For example, in\nconjunction with cyberattacks, adversaries may spread false disaster reporting via social media and\nother means in order to incite panic and disrupt response operations. Thus, continuous engagement\nestablishing regular and clear communication between response partners is essential to ensuring that\naccurate, accessible, and actionable information and situational awareness is made available in\nresponse to these and other emerging threats.\nTiered Response\nMost incidents begin and end locally and are managed and executed at the local or tribal level. Incidents\nrequire a unified response from local agencies, the private sector, tribes, and NGOs. Some may require\nadditional support from neighboring jurisdictions or state governments. A smaller number of incidents\nrequire federal support.13 Incidents that occur within or along the borders of federally managed lands\nand state, tribal, and territorial lands require unity of effort among federal, state, tribal, or territorial\ngovernments at the local level. National response processes are structured to provide tiered levels of\nsupport when additional resources or capabilities are needed.\n12 Information, warnings, and communications associated with emergency management must ensure effective\ncommunication, such as through the use of appropriate auxiliary aids and services (e.g., interpreters, captioning, and\nalternative format documents) for individuals with disabilities and provide meaningful access to limited English-\nproficient individuals. Accessible messaging should be employed for individuals who use assistive technology and\nemploy non-technological means to reach those who do not have access to communication technology and those living\nin remote areas.\n13 Certain incidents such as a pandemic or cyberattack may not be limited to a specific geographic area and may be\nmanaged at the local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, or federal level, depending on the nature of the incident.\n6"

      "text": "National Response Framework\nWhen all levels of government become engaged, a response is federally supported, state managed, and\nlocally executed, with tribes, territories, and insular area governments often managing the response, as\nwell. The Federal Government’s support and response during disasters build on and are affected by the\ncapacity of state, tribal, territorial, insular, and local governments, as well as the business community\nand NGOs. Preparedness efforts with partners at all levels increase the effectiveness of tiered response.\nScalable, Flexible, and Adaptable Operational Capabilities\nAs incidents change in size, scope, and complexity, response efforts must adapt to meet evolving\nrequirements. The number, type, and sources of resources must be able to expand rapidly to meet the\nchanging needs associated with a given incident and its cascading effects. As needs grow and change,\nresponse processes must remain nimble, adaptable, and resilient. The structures and processes\ndescribed in the NRF must be able to apply resources from the whole community to support disaster\nsurvivors and stabilize the community. As incidents stabilize, response efforts must be flexible to\nfacilitate the integration of recovery activities.\nUnity of Effort Through Unified Command\nThe NIMS concept of unified command14 maximizes response efforts while integrating and respecting\nthe roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of all participating organizations. The Incident Command\nSystem (ICS), as prescribed by NIMS, is important to ensuring interoperability across\nmultijurisdictional or multiagency incident management activities. Unified command enables unity of\neffort when no single jurisdiction, agency, or organization has primary authority and/or the resources\nto manage an incident on its own. The use of unified command enables jurisdictions and those with\nauthority or responsibility for the incident to jointly manage and direct incident activities through\nestablishment of common incident objectives, strategies, and a single incident action plan. ICS is used\nby all levels of government, as well as by many NGOs and private sector organizations.\nReadiness To Act\nFrom individuals and communities to businesses, nonprofit, faith-based, and voluntary organizations\nand all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal), national response\ndepends on the ability to act decisively. A forward-leaning posture is imperative for incidents that may\nexpand rapidly in size, scope, or complexity, as well as incidents that occur without warning. Decisive\naction is often required to save lives and protect property and the environment. Although some risk to\nresponders may be unavoidable, all response personnel are responsible for anticipating and managing\nrisk through proper planning, organizing, equipping, training, and exercising.\n14 The ICS “unified command” concept is distinct from the military use of this term. Concepts of “command” and\n“unity of command” have distinct legal and cultural meanings for military forces and military operations. Military\nforces always remain under the control of the military chain of command and are subject to redirection or recall at any\ntime. Military forces do not operate under the command of the incident commander or under the unified command\nstructure, but they do coordinate with response partners and work toward a unity of effort while maintaining their\ninternal chain of command.\n7"

Proactive efforts are intended to ensure that federal resources reach the scene in time to assist\nin reducing disruption of normal functions of local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments\nand are done in coordination and collaboration with the governments, private sector entities, and NGOs,\nwhen possible.\nFoundational Components\nPrioritized Stabilization of Community Lifelines\nStabilizing community lifelines is the primary effort during response to lessen threats and hazards to\npublic health and safety, the economy, and security. A community lifeline enables the continuous\noperation of critical government and business functions and is essential to human health and safety or\neconomic security. Together, the community lifelines reframe incident information to provide decision\nmakers with root cause and impact analysis. This construct maximizes the effectiveness of federally\nsupported, state managed, and locally executed response. Figure 1 identifies the seven community\nlifelines: Safety and Security; Food, Water, Shelter; Health and Medical; Energy (Power & Fuel);\nCommunications; Transportation; and Hazardous Material.\nFigure 1: Community Lifelines for Incident Stabilization\nThe seven community lifelines represent only the most basic services a community relies on and which,\nwhen stable, enable all other activity within a community. The lifelines are designed to enable\nemergency managers, infrastructure owners and operators, and other partners to analyze the root cause\nof an incident impact and then prioritize and deploy resources to effectively stabilize the lifeline. As\nexplained later in the NRF, ESFs deliver core capabilities to stabilize community lifelines for an\neffective response. Similar to the ESFs, other whole community organizations can work together to\nstabilize lifelines and meet disaster needs. The community lifelines do not directly cover all important\naspects of community life that can be affected by an incident, including impacts to natural, historical,\nand cultural resources. For example, financial and economic issues important to the life and safety of\naffected individuals may also arise indirectly from impacts to lifelines during an incident.\n15 National security emergency means any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological\nemergency, or other emergency, that seriously degrades or threatens the national security of the United States, as\ndefined in Executive Order 12656.\n8"

Among the major impacts to\ncommunity lifelines is the community’s inability to access money.\n Power outages have kept several bank branches closed and automated teller\nmachines (ATM) inoperable, and merchants who are open despite the power outages\nare only able to accept cash transactions.\n Some merchants, ATMs, and bank branches are already open and have been\nenergized through grid or generator power. However, communications outages\nprevent them from accessing systems to process an electronic transaction.\n Transportation issues (road closures and blockages) limit survivors’ ability to travel to\nthe limited merchants, ATM locations, and bank branches in the area, as well as\nresponders’ ability to provide assets to stabilize critical infrastructure.\nThese cumulative effects, while incredibly disruptive to the community, are caused by a\nconfluence of impacts to specific lifelines. By using the community lifeline construct and\nroot cause analysis, emergency managers can assess that the major limiting factors\nrestricting community access to money are through the power, transportation, and\ncommunications lifelines. Accordingly, a local emergency manager may alleviate the\nsituation by considering options, such as prioritized route clearance for emergency access\nby power and communications crews, generators for temporary power, or deployment of\nmobile cell towers, for establishing connectivity until other infrastructure is restored.\nThe community lifelines are composed of multiple components that encompass infrastructure, assets,\nand services. Table 1 provides a brief description of each community lifeline but is not a comprehensive\nlist of all components that should be analyzed.\nTable 1: Community Lifeline Descriptions\nCommunity Lifeline Description\n• Law enforcement and government services, as well as the associated\nassets that maintain communal security, provide search and rescue,\nSafety and Security\nevacuations, and firefighting capabilities, and promote responder\nsafety.\n• Support systems that enable the sustainment of life, such as water\ntreatment, transmission, and distribution systems; food retail and\nFood, Water, Shelter\ndistribution networks; wastewater collection and treatment systems; as\nwell as sheltering, and agriculture.\n• Infrastructure and service providers for medical care, public health,\nHealth and Medical patient movement, fatality management, behavioral health, veterinary\nsupport, and health or medical supply chains.\n• Service providers for electric power infrastructure, composed of\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution systems, as well as gas and\nEnergy liquid fuel processing, transportation, and delivery systems.

This includes assessment of facilities that use, generate,\nHazardous Material and store hazardous substances, as well as specialized conveyance\nassets and efforts to identify, contain, and remove incident debris,\npollution, contaminants, oil or other hazardous substances.\nAs described in Table 1, community lifelines rely on multiple government entities, businesses, and\ninfrastructure sectors to function. As a result, response operations to stabilize a lifeline are unlikely to\nfit within a single department, agency, ESF, infrastructure sector, or industry. Moreover, because these\nsectors and the community lifelines they support are interdependent, failures in one will cascade across\nto others.\nAccounting for these interdependencies and their associated requirements for cross-sector assistance\nthey entail poses overarching challenges in building preparedness for complex incidents. The\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the sector-specific agencies, has\nidentified National Critical Functions16 that enable the Federal Government, in partnership with\ninfrastructure owners and operators, to improve the risk management process before and after an\nincident and can support community lifeline assessments and stabilization efforts.\nCommunity lifelines can be used by all levels of government, the private sector, and other partners to\nfacilitate operational coordination and drive outcome-based response. Figure 2 shows how community\nlifelines are applied to support decision-making.\nFigure 2: The Application of Community Lifelines to Support Emergency Management\n16 National Critical Functions are the functions of government and the private sector so vital to the United States that\ntheir disruption, corruption, or dysfunction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security,\nnational public health or safety, or any combination thereof.\n10"

Decision makers must\nrapidly determine the scope, complexity, and interdependent impacts of a disaster, so applying the\ncommunity lifeline construct will allow them to do the following:\n Prioritize, sequence, and focus response efforts toward maintaining or restoring the most critical\nservices and infrastructure;\n Utilize a common lexicon to facilitate communication across various stakeholders;\n Promote a response that facilitates unity of effort among the whole community (e.g., Federal\nGovernment; state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and local governments; and private sector and\nnongovernmental entities); and\n Clarify which components of the disaster are complex (emergent) and/or complicated (difficult),\nrequiring cross-sector coordination.\nResponse activities organized around the community lifelines allow local, state, tribal, territorial,\ninsular, and Federal Government emergency managers, along with private sector and nongovernmental\npartners, to better align, sequence, and prioritize limited public and private sector resources.

NIMS concepts provide\nfor standardized but flexible incident management and support practices that emphasize common\nprinciples, a consistent approach for operational structures and supporting mechanisms, and an\nintegrated approach to resource management. The response protocols and structures described in the\nNRF align with NIMS. NIMS provides the template for the management of incidents, regardless of\nsize, scope, cause, or complexity, while the NRF provides the structure and mechanisms for policy\nimplementation and incident response. Standardizing national response doctrine on NIMS integrates\nthe capabilities and resources of various governmental jurisdictions, incident management and\nemergency response disciplines, NGOs, and the private sector into a cohesive, coordinated, and\nseamless national framework for incident response.\nAll of the components of NIMS—resource management, command and coordination, and\ncommunications and information management—support response. The NIMS concept of unified\ncommand is described in the command and coordination component of NIMS. This concept is essential\nto effective response operations because it addresses the importance of (1) developing a single set of\nobjectives; (2) using a collective, strategic approach; (3) improving information flow and coordination;\n(4) creating a common understanding of joint priorities and limitations; (5) ensuring that no agency’s\nlegal authorities are compromised or neglected; and (6) optimizing the combined efforts of all\nparticipants under a single plan.\n11"

Various public and private mutual aid systems can be\nleveraged. Neighboring communities or organizations play a key role by providing support through a\nnetwork of mutual aid and assistance agreements that identify the resources that communities may\nshare during an incident. Additionally, private sector organizations often establish mutual aid\nagreements with each other to increase capabilities and expedite their response.\nThe ability to provide mutual aid accurately and rapidly is critical during disasters, but mutual aid\npartners require a common language and process to support the sharing of qualified personnel. The\nNational Qualification System (NQS) addresses this challenge by providing a common language and\napproach for qualifying, certifying, and credentialing incident management and support personnel.\nNQS provides the tools for jurisdictions and organizations to share resources seamlessly. Using the\nNQS approach helps to ensure personnel deploying through mutual aid agreements and compacts have\nthe required capabilities to perform their assigned duties.17\nCore Capabilities\nEach mission area—prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery—identifies core\ncapabilities required to address common threats and hazards. Using the core capabilities construct\nenables communities and organizations to focus on specific preparedness measures necessary to ensure\nthat the capabilities are available when needed. By allowing communities and organizations to quantify\nresponse requirements and measure response capacity, core capabilities are the key performance\nmanagement tool in emergency preparedness.18\nThe National Preparedness Goal describes the core capabilities necessary to be prepared for all threats\nand hazards. The core capabilities provide a common vocabulary describing the significant functions\nthat must be maintained and executed across the whole community to achieve the goal of a “secure\nand resilient nation.”\nPrevention: Avoiding, preventing, or stopping a threatened or actual act of terrorism.\nWithin the context of national preparedness, the term “prevention” refers to dealing with\nimminent threats.\nProtection: Securing the homeland against acts of terrorism and human-caused or natural\ndisasters.\nMitigation: Reducing loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.\nResponse: Saving lives, stabilizing community lifelines, protecting property and the\nenvironment, and meeting basic human needs after an incident has occurred.\nRecovery: Assisting impacted communities with restoration and revitalization.\nThe response core capabilities are the activities that generally must be accomplished in incident\nresponse, regardless of which levels of government are involved. While core capabilities are organized\nby mission area, they do not operate exclusively within that mission area.

Protection of critical infrastructure systems and implementation of plans for the rapid\nrestoration of commercial activities and critical infrastructure operations are crucial aspects of the\nprotection mission area. Many of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors19 within the protection mission\narea are also represented in the response mission area. The existing infrastructure plans and\ncoordination mechanisms (e.g., sector-specific agencies and councils) provide strong foundations for\nstrengthening incident response plans and capabilities.

Planning, response,\nand regulatory organizations coordinate to reduce risks to critical infrastructure by evaluating potential\nthreats, encouraging resiliency in infrastructure, and planning for redundancy in services.

Ensuring that operational plans\nproperly account for the integration of all mission areas is essential.\nOperational Coordination\nIncident management begins and ends locally, and most incidents are managed or executed at the\nclosest possible geographical, organizational, and jurisdictional levels. Successful incident\nmanagement often depends on the cooperation of multiple jurisdictions, levels of government,\nfunctional agencies, NGOs and emergency responder disciplines, and the private sector, which requires\neffective coordination across a broad spectrum of activities and organizations.

When government, private\nsector, and NGO resources are mutually supportive and aligned, there is a much better chance of\nmeeting communities’ incident and economic recovery needs. All elements of the community should\nbe activated, engaged, and integrated to respond to a major or catastrophic incident. This all-inclusive\napproach helps expand and expedite the availability of resources, capabilities, and solution sets for\nincident response. When severe incidents disrupt community lifelines, private sector and NGO\ncapabilities can assist with stabilizing lifelines and restoring services. Similar to public sector mutual\naid and support agreements, it is essential that government and private sector organizations engage in\ncollaboration before an incident to effectively partner during incident response.\nBusinesses and infrastructure owners and operators have primary responsibility for operating and\nrepairing their systems in emergencies.

When catastrophic incidents put a premium on the restoration of complex supply chains\n(especially for essential products and services needed for response efforts and stabilizing the economy),\nprivate sector coordination and assets are vital for public health and safety, the economy, and national\nsecurity. The private sector can also help government agencies prioritize support missions (e.g., debris\nremoval) to facilitate business and infrastructure response operations.\nIn coordination with local governments, private sector organizations have a critical role in re-\nestablishing commercial activities and restoring critical infrastructure operations the community\nrequires following a disruption. The resilience of private sector organizations directly affects\ncommunity recovery by providing products and services, employment opportunities, other resources\nand re-establishing a functioning economy. In many cases, private sector organizations also have\nimmediate access to commodities and services that support incident response.\nGovernmental response organizations should coordinate closely with private sector partners to do the\nfollowing:\n Assess cross-sector interdependencies and obstacles to meeting survivor needs;\n Identify opportunities to enable or support prompt stabilization of community lifelines;\n Identify where government support is appropriate and available; and\n Identify opportunities to synchronize response operations with private sector efforts to ensure the\nmost effective approach to reach as many survivors as possible.\nPrivate Sector Coordinating Structures\nCoordinating structures for the private sector include business emergency operations centers (BEOC),\nindustry trade groups and coordinating councils, information sharing and analysis centers, private\nsector information and intelligence centers, and other structural entities, such as healthcare coalitions.\nThese organizations, composed of multiple businesses and entities brought together by shared\ngeography or common function (e.g., banking, supply chain management, transportation, venue, and\nmanagement), support the collaboration, communication, and sharing of information within the private\nsector. Such organizations can coordinate with and support NGOs and, in many cases, serve as a\nconduit to government coordinating structures. Strengthening the relationship between private sector\nand government coordinating structures enhances information sharing and operational response.\nLocally Executed Response\nDuring a disaster, those closest to the impacted areas—individuals, families, neighbors, businesses,\nand emergency responders comprising the community—are the first ones active in response. Local\npartners know their community’s needs, capabilities, and resources best and are positioned to have the\nmost effective impact in the aftermath of an incident. Locally executed response focuses on how the\ncomplex network of local, voluntary, and private sector organizations integrate their capabilities to\nrestore damaged infrastructure, restart the flow of products and services, and place essential items into\nthe hands of survivors. Local governments and communities, therefore, provide the true operational\ncoordination for executing an effective response and can draw on the support of additional state and\nfederal resources when their own resources prove insufficient.\nEmergency responders at all levels of government use NIMS and ICS command and coordinating\nstructures to manage and support response operations (Figure 3). ICS is a management system designed\nto integrate on-scene facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications within a\ncommon organizational structure. Emergency operations centers (EOC) are facilities where staff\n16"

Staff in EOCs at\nall levels of government may also encourage participation by private sector elements including NGOs,\nacademia, associations, and organizations representing those with disabilities and others with access\nand functional needs.\nAt the local level, coordinating structures are usually composed of entities within specific functional\nareas, such as public works, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and fire departments. On-\nscene integration among these structures may occur at incident command posts (ICP) and more\nfrequently at one or more local EOCs.\nFigure 3: Example of an ICS organization with a Single Incident Commander20\nIncident management may also involve Multiagency Coordination Groups (MAC Groups). A MAC\nGroup is composed of senior officials, such as agency administrators, executives, or their designees,\nwho are authorized to represent or commit agency resources and funds in support of incident activities.\nA MAC Group acts as an executive- or policy-level body during incidents, supporting resource\nprioritization and allocation, and enabling decision making among elected and appointed officials and\nthose responsible for managing the incident (i.e., the incident commander). In some communities and\njurisdictions, MAC Groups are located at or near EOCs in order to authorize additional resources,\napprove emergency authorities, and provide guidance on issues.\nLocal Coordinating Structures\nLocal jurisdictions and states employ a variety of coordinating structures to help identify risks,\nestablish relationships, and organize and build capabilities. Due to the unique partnerships, geographic\nconditions, threats, and capabilities, the coordinating structures vary. Examples of local response\n20 For more information on NIMS and ICS, see https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1508151197225-\nced8c60378c3936adb92c1a3ee6f6564/FINAL_NIMS_2017.pdf.\n17"

These local and\nregional coordinating structures organize and integrate their capabilities and resources with\nneighboring jurisdictions, the state, the private sector, and NGOs.\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Managed Response\nState governments serve as agents for local jurisdictions by managing the delivery of federal disaster\nassistance to meet local requirements. While the local incident command structure directs on-scene\nincident management activities and maintains command and control of on-scene incident operations,\nstate EOCs are activated as necessary to support local EOCs and to help ensure that responders have\nthe resources they need to conduct response activities. This is achieved through integration of state-\nlevel coordinating structures working with local coordinating structures or the local incident command\nstructure.\nState, tribal, territorial, and insular area EOCs also provide a common location for coordination of\nstate/tribal/territorial/insular area—and in some cases, federal—support to local EOCs and/or incident\npersonnel. Most states, tribal organizations, territories, and insular areas maintain an EOC to manage\nincidents requiring state-level assistance. Some of these governments have additional EOCs for\ncoordinating information and resources within a region or area.\nMany states involve their tribal counterparts within the EOC to ensure that tribal coordinating\nstructures are integrated into the delivery of capabilities and tribal needs are addressed.\nState, Territorial, and Insular Area Coordinating Structures\nStates, territories, and insular areas also leverage the capabilities and resources of partners across the\nstate/territory/insular area when identifying needs and building capabilities. The coordinating\nstructures at the state, territorial, or insular area level also vary, depending on factors such as\ngeography, population, industry, and the capabilities of the local jurisdictions. These structures are also\ndesigned to leverage appropriate representatives from across the whole community, some of whom\nmay also participate in local or regional coordinating structures. Many states, territories, and insular\nareas create independent committees or councils focused on specific areas or functions as a sub-set of\ntheir emergency management agency.\nTribal Managed Response\nThe United States has a trust responsibility with federally recognized Indian tribes and recognizes their\nright to self-government. This trust doctrine requires the Federal Government to protect tribal treaty\nrights, lands, assets, and resources while providing support through statutory authority and other\nprograms. Under the Stafford Act, federally recognized Indian tribes may directly request their own\nemergency and major declaration or they may request assistance under a state request. In addition,\nfederally recognized Indian tribes can request federal assistance for incidents that impact the tribe but\ndo not result in a Stafford Act declaration. Given their unique position, tribal governments often have\nplanning and response requirements that are the equivalent of state and local operational coordination\nduring an incident.\n21 Healthcare coalitions are multi-agency coordination groups that integrate member organizations with the\njurisdictional agency(s) in the geographic area in which they operate. Healthcare coalitions are invaluable as public-\nprivate partnerships integrating healthcare facilities with emergency medical services, public health, and emergency\nmanagement.\n18"

Tribes may have internal coordinating\nstructures and facilities for incident response, as well as others that include bordering states and\nneighboring jurisdictions.\nThe Tribal Assistance Coordination Group (TAC-G) is a MAC Group that assists federally recognized\ntribes during emergencies and disasters and provides information and technical assistance for tribal\nemergency management programs in coordination with federal partners. The TAC-G is led and\nmanaged by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Emergency Management Program. The TAC-G consists of\npartners from all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular, or federal), as well as\nnonprofit aid organizations and the private sector.\nFederally Supported Response\nFederal support during response operations focuses on the capabilities necessary to save lives; protect\nproperty and the environment; meet basic human needs; prioritize operations to stabilize community\nlifelines and restore basic services and community functionality; establish a safe, secure, and accessible\nenvironment for responders and response operations; and support the transition to recovery. The\ndesired end-state for federal incident response is achieved when local, state, tribal, territorial, and\ninsular area entities no longer require Federal Government assistance to provide life-saving or life-\nsustaining support, thereby allowing for the transition to recovery.\nWhen an incident occurs that exceeds or is anticipated to exceed local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea resources or when an incident is managed by federal departments or agencies acting under their\nown authorities, the Federal Government may use the management structures described within the\nNRF. Additionally, the Federal Government may use supplementary or complementary plans to\ninvolve all necessary department and agency resources to organize the federal response and ensure\ncoordination among all response partners.\nDifferent federal departments and agencies may play significant roles in response activities, depending\non the nature and size of an incident. Many of the arrangements by which departments and agencies\nparticipate are defined in the ESF annexes coordinated through pre-scripted mission assignments in a\nStafford Act response, formalized in interagency agreements, or described in supplementary plans.\nThe following sections describe federal support operations at the incident, regional, and headquarters\nlevels.\nFederal Incident-level Operations\nTo help deliver federal support or response at the incident level, coordinating structures are aligned to\nincident-level structures.\nUnified Coordination\nUnified coordination is the term used to describe the primary state/tribal/territorial/insular area/federal\nincident management activities conducted at the incident level. Unified coordination is typically\ndirected from a Joint Field Office (JFO), a temporary federal facility that provides a central location\nfor coordination of response efforts by the private sector, NGOs, and all levels of government. Unified\ncoordination is organized, staffed, and managed in a manner consistent with NIMS principles using an\nICS structure. The Unified Coordination Group (UCG) is composed of senior leaders representing\nstate, tribal, territorial, insular area and federal interests and, in certain circumstances, local\n19"

The composition of the UCG varies from incident to incident, depending\non the scope and nature of the disaster. The UCG leads the unified coordination staff. Personnel from\nstate, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal departments and agencies; other jurisdictional entities;\nthe private sector; and NGOs may be assigned to the unified coordination staff at various incident\nfacilities (e.g., JFOs, staging areas, and other field offices). The UCG determines staffing of the unified\ncoordination staff based on incident requirements.\nAlthough unified coordination is based on the ICS structure, it does not manage on-scene operations.\nInstead, unified coordination supports on-scene response efforts and conducts broader support\noperations that may extend beyond the incident site. Unified coordination must include robust\noperations, planning, public information, and logistics capabilities that integrate local, state, and\nfederal—as well as tribal, territorial, and insular area governments—personnel, when appropriate, so\nthat all levels of government work together to achieve unity of effort.\nWhen incidents affect multiple localities and states or the entire Nation, multiple UCGs with associated\nunified coordination staff may be established. In these situations, coordination occurs according to the\nprinciples of area command, as described in NIMS.\nAs the primary field entity for federal response, unified coordination integrates diverse federal\nauthorities and capabilities and coordinates federal response and recovery operations. Figure 4 shows\na unified coordination organization that might be assembled to deal with a major incident—such as a\nterrorist attack—that includes a law enforcement dimension. Federal agencies that conduct on-scene,\ntactical-level activities may also establish incident and area command structures, generally in\nconjunction with their counterpart local, state, tribal, territorial and/or insular area government\nagencies, to manage that work.\nFigure 4: Unified Coordination\n20"

Whatever structures are used, they are encouraged\nto work closely with federal ESFs at the incident, regional, or headquarters levels if they are activated.\nThe Federal Government and many state governments organize their response resources and\ncapabilities under the ESF construct. Each ESF is composed of a department or agency that has been\ndesignated as the ESF coordinator, along with a number of primary and support agencies. Primary\nagencies are designated on the basis of their authorities, resources, and capabilities. Support agencies\nare assigned based on resources or capabilities in a given functional area. To the extent possible,\nresources provided by the ESFs are identified consistently with NIMS resource typing categories.\nESFs have proven to be an effective way to organize and manage resources to deliver core capabilities.\nThe federal ESFs are the primary, but not exclusive, federal coordinating structures for building,\nsustaining, and delivering the response core capabilities.\nAt the federal level, ESFs are groups of organizations that work together to deliver core capabilities to\nstabilize community lifelines in support of an effective response. Any ESF may assist in the delivery\nof a response core capability. Because a core capability may be required, each ESF can contribute to\nthe stabilization of any of the community lifelines, depending on the circumstances of the incident.\nTable 3 provides an example of actions each ESF may take to support incident issues arising within\nthe health and medical lifeline; these actions may impact more than one of the other community\nlifelines.\nTable 3: Example Actions That an ESF May Take in Support of Stabilizing the Health and Medical\nLifeline During Incident Response Operations\nESF Example Supporting Actions or Capabilities\nCoordinate the opening of roads and manage aviation airspace for\nESF #1 Transportation\naccess to health and medical facilities or services.\nProvide and enable contingency communications required at health and\nESF #2 Communications\nmedical facilities.\nESF #3 Public Works & Install generators and provide other temporary emergency power\nEngineering sources for health and medical facilities.\nCoordinates federal firefighting activities and supports resource\nESF #4 Firefighting\nrequests for public health and medical facilities and teams.\nESF #5 Information & Develop coordinated interagency crisis action plans addressing health\nPlanning and medical issues.\nESF #6 Mass Care,\nIntegrate voluntary agency and other partner support, including other\nEmergency Assistance,\nfederal agencies and the private sector, to resource health and medical\nTemporary Housing, &\nservices and supplies.\nHuman Assistance\nProvide logistics support for moving meals, water, or other\nESF #7 Logistics\ncommodities.\nESF #8 Public Health & Provide health and medical support to communities, and coordinate\nMedical Services across capabilities of partner agencies.\nESF #9 Search & Rescue Conduct initial health and medical needs assessments.\n21"

Governments are\nencouraged to engage members of the whole community as part of whatever coordinating processes\nthey use.\nDepartments and agencies supporting federal ESFs may be selectively activated by FEMA or as\nrequested by a lead federal agency to support response activities for incidents. Not all incidents\nrequiring federal support result in the activation of ESFs.\nWhen departments and agencies supporting federal ESFs are activated, they may assign staff at\nheadquarters, regional, and incident levels. Through the Stafford Act and in accordance with 6 U.S.C.\nSections 741(4) and 753(c), FEMA may issue mission assignments to obtain resources and services\nfrom federal departments and agencies.\nIncidents Without a Stafford Act Declaration\nMost incidents where the NRF serves as the foundational federal response doctrine will not result in a\nfederally declared disaster under the Stafford Act. For example, pre-incident operations for hurricanes,\nresponses to biological incidents, electric grid emergencies, oil spills, migration crises, public health\nemergencies, and a host of other threats and hazards may not receive a Presidential disaster declaration\nbut still require a coordinated national response.\nFor such non-Stafford Act incidents where the Federal Government is involved, the President may\ndesignate or the federal agencies involved may agree to recognize an agency to serve as the Lead\nFederal Agency (LFA) for the response. The LFA typically activates the response structures\nappropriate to its authorities. The LFA employs NIMS and this Framework to coordinate the federal\nresponse. Details regarding federal operations for non-Stafford incidents are contained within the\nrelevant statutes and policies. Because the NRF is always in effect, ESFs may be activated and\ndeployed to help manage any response in support of the LFA.\n22"

Some federal departments and agencies share the\nsame standard federal regional structure as FEMA. In larger-scale incidents, these regional and field\noffices may provide the initial response assets with additional support being provided from other\ndepartment and agency offices across the Nation. Some federal regional and field offices have their\nown EOCs to support deployments of their assets.\n FEMA Regional Response Coordination Center (RRCC). FEMA has 10 regional offices, each\nheaded by a Regional Administrator. Each of FEMA’s regional offices maintains an RRCC. When\nactivated, RRCCs are multi-agency coordination centers generally staffed by regional FEMA\npersonnel and augmented by ESFs and other federal agencies in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing an incident. Operating under the direction of the FEMA Regional Administrator, the\nstaff within the RRCCs coordinates federal regional response efforts and maintains connectivity\nwith FEMA Headquarters and with state EOCs, state and major urban area fusion centers, Federal\nExecutive Boards, tribal governments, and other federal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\noperations and coordination centers that potentially contribute to the development of situational\nawareness. The UCG assumes responsibility for coordinating federal response activities at the\nincident level once unified coordination is established, freeing the RRCC to deal with new\nincidents should they occur.\n Joint Operations Center (JOC). In response to significant threats within the criminal jurisdiction\nof the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may establish a JOC, which is a\nregional multi-jurisdictional, interagency operations center to lead and coordinate the operational\nlaw enforcement response, including but not limited to investigative operations and related\nintelligence activities. The JOC is led by an FBI on-scene commander (OSC) and is supported by\na command group and a consequence management group, as appropriate. If the threat involves\npotential attacks or threats spanning multiple geographic areas, then multiple JOCs may be\nestablished. The JOC acts as the focal point for the strategic management and direction of on scene\nlaw enforcement activities and coordination with local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\nauthorities. Additionally, the FBI OSC may be supported by the Domestic Emergency Support\nTeam (if deployed), which may provide interagency technical or scientific expertise.\nFederal Headquarters Operational Support\nCoordinating structures are assembled and organized at the federal headquarters level, particularly to\naddress incidents that cross regional borders or have broad geographic or system-wide implications.\nFederal Operations Centers\nMost Cabinet-level and some other federal departments and agencies have headquarters-level\noperations centers.

The NSC advises and assists the President in\nintegrating all aspects of national security policy as it affects the United States—domestic, foreign,\nmilitary, intelligence, and economic (in conjunction with the National Economic Council).\nRoles and Responsibilities for Response\nThis section describes those roles and responsibilities and sharpens the focus on identifying who is\ninvolved with the response mission area. This section also addresses what the various partners must do\nto deliver the response core capabilities and to integrate successfully with the prevention, protection,\nmitigation, and recovery mission areas.\nAn effective, unified national response requires layered, mutually supporting capabilities. Individuals\nand communities, the private sector, NGOs, and all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial,\ninsular area, and federal) should each understand their respective roles and responsibilities and how to\ncomplement each other in achieving shared goals. All elements of the whole community play roles in\ndeveloping the core capabilities needed to respond to incidents. This includes developing plans that\nensure continuity of operations, conducting assessments and exercises, providing and directing\nresources and capabilities, and gathering lessons-learned. These activities require that all partners\nunderstand how they fit within and are supported by the structures described in the NRF.\nEmergency management staff in all jurisdictions and organizations have a fundamental responsibility\nto consider the needs of the whole community. These needs must be incorporated into response\nplanning and delivery of the core capabilities. The potential contributions of all individuals toward\ndelivering core capabilities during incident response (e.g., through associations and alliances that serve\nthe people previously identified) should be incorporated into planning efforts.\n25"

This includes those with household pets, service and assistance animals,\nworking dogs, and agricultural animals/livestock, as well as those who have responsibility for wildlife,\nexotic animals, zoo animals, research animals, and animals housed in shelters, rescue organizations,\nbreeding facilities, and sanctuaries.\nCommunities\nCommunities are groups that share goals, values, and institutions. Communities are not always limited\nby geographic boundaries or political divisions. Instead, communities may be faith-based\norganizations; voluntary organizations; neighborhood partnerships; advocacy groups; academia;\ncultural, social, and community groups; and associations. Communities bring people together in\ndifferent ways for different reasons, but each community provides opportunities for sharing\ninformation and promoting collective action. These communities may have resources and information\nto stabilize community lifelines. Engaging these groups in preparedness efforts, particularly at the\nlocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area levels, is important to identifying their needs and taking\nadvantage of their potential contributions.\nPrivate Sector\nPrivate sector organizations engage in incident response through their own internal response and\ncontinuity actions, the commodities they provide, their partnerships with each level of government,\nand their roles within the supply chain. Elements of the private sector are most often the providers of\ncommunity lifeline services and have a key interest in the stabilization and restoration of their own\noperations and those of other infrastructure systems. Private sector organizations also play a vital role\nin ensuring communities and survivors have the services and resources necessary to respond to and\nrecover from all types of incidents. The private sector, comprised of small, medium, and large\nbusinesses, spans nationally significant infrastructure to locally owned and operated businesses that,\nwhile small, are staples of the community. The private sector includes commerce; healthcare; private,\ncultural, and educational institutions; and industry, as well as public/private partnerships that have been\nestablished specifically for emergency management purposes. During an incident, key private sector\npartners should have a direct link to emergency managers and other relevant officials, such as those\nfrom public health, economic development, and community planning agencies and, in some cases, be\ninvolved in the decision-making process. Strong integration into response efforts can offer many\nbenefits to the public and private sectors.\nAs key elements of the national economy, it is important for private sector organizations of all types\nand sizes to engage in preparedness planning, conduct risk assessments, and identify critical\ncommunity lifelines, functions, and resources that impact their businesses and communities.\nUnderstanding and collaborating on the cross-sector interdependencies and cascading effects of a\npotentially high-consequence incident on business, infrastructure, and supply chains improves\ncommunity resilience and can help private sector organizations to quickly resume normal operations.\nUltimately, the ability of the private sector to recover is inextricably linked to community recovery.\nOwners and operators of certain regulated facilities or hazardous operations may be legally responsible\nfor preparing for and preventing incidents and responding when an incident occurs. For example, the\nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, and associated regulations require owners and operators of\ncommercial nuclear powerplants and offsite response organizations (OROs) to maintain emergency\nplans in order protect the health and safety of the public.

During an actual disaster, emergency, or threat,\nindividuals, households, and families should monitor emergency communications and follow guidance\nand instructions provided by local authorities.\nNongovernmental Organizations\nNGOs are a distinct category of organizations within the private sector that can support disaster\nresponse and recovery. NGOs include voluntary, ethnic, faith-based, veteran-based, disability, and\nnonprofit organizations that provide sheltering, emergency food supplies, and other essential support\nservices for people, household pets, and service animals. NGOs are inherently independent and\ncommitted to specific interests and values. These interests and values drive the groups’ operational\npriorities and shape the resources they provide. NGOs bolster government efforts at all levels and often\nprovide specialized services to the whole community. NGOs are key partners in preparedness activities\nand response operations.\nExamples of NGO contributions include the following:\n Training, management, and coordination of volunteers and donated goods;\n Ensuring staff are screened, trained, and able to safely perform their tasks;\n Identifying sheltering locations, ensuring access to those facilities, and communicating their\nlocations to the whole community;\n Providing emergency commodities and services, such as water, food, shelter, assistance with\nfamily reunification, clothing, and supplies for post-emergency cleanup;\n Supporting the evacuation, rescue, care, and sheltering of animals displaced by the incident;\n Supporting search and rescue, transportation, and logistics services and support;\n Identifying and supporting the unmet needs of survivors who have been affected by the disaster;\n Identifying and supporting the heath, medical, mental health, and behavior health resources of the\nimpacted community; and\n Supporting disaster survivors, identifying unmet needs, and developing individual recovery plans.\nAt the same time, when NGOs support response core capabilities they may also require government\nassistance. When planning for local community emergency management resources, government\norganizations should consider the potential need to support NGOs in performing their essential\nresponse functions. Volunteers and donors support response efforts in many ways. Governments at all\nlevels must plan ahead to incorporate volunteers and donated resources into response activities. Close\ncollaboration with the voluntary organizations and agencies assists in managing the influx of\nvolunteers and donations.

Lives\nmay depend on their decisions. Elected and appointed officials also routinely shape or modify laws,\npolicies, and budgets to aid preparedness efforts and improve emergency management and response\ncapabilities. The local chief executive’s response duties may include the following:\n Obtaining assistance from other governmental agencies,\n Providing direction for response activities, and\n Ensuring appropriate information is provided to the public.\nLocal Emergency Manager\nThe jurisdiction’s emergency manager oversees the day-to-day emergency management programs and\nactivities. The emergency manager works with chief elected and appointed officials to establish unified\nobjectives regarding the jurisdiction’s emergency plans and activities. This role entails coordinating\nand integrating all elements of the community. The emergency manager coordinates the local\nemergency management program. This includes assessing the capacity and readiness to deliver the\ncapabilities most likely required to stabilize community lifelines during an incident and identifying\nand correcting shortfalls.

In certain\ncircumstances, the President may declare an emergency without a request from a governor when the\nprimary responsibility for response rests with the United States because the emergency involves a\nsubject area for which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the United States exercises\nexclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority.\nThe Stafford Act authorizes the President to provide financial and other assistance to local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, and insular area governments; certain private nonprofit organizations; and individuals to\nsupport response, recovery, and mitigation efforts following a Stafford Act emergency or major\ndisaster declaration.33 Most forms of Stafford Act assistance require a cost share. While federal\nassistance under the Stafford Act may only be delivered after a declaration, FEMA may pre-deploy\nfederal assets when a declaration is likely and imminent. The Stafford Act provides for two types of\ndeclarations:\n An emergency declaration is more limited in scope than a major disaster declaration, involves\nfewer federal programs, and is not normally associated with recovery programs. However, the\nPresident may issue an emergency declaration prior to an actual incident to lessen or avert the\nthreat of a catastrophe. Generally, federal assistance and funding are provided to meet specific\nemergency needs or to help prevent a catastrophe from occurring.\n A major disaster declaration provides more federal programs for response and recovery than an\nemergency declaration. Unlike an emergency declaration, a major disaster declaration may only be\nissued after an incident.\nFederal Departments and Agencies Acting Under Their Own\nAuthorities\nImmediate life-saving assistance to states, tribes, territories, and insular areas, as well as other types of\nassistance, such as wildland firefighting support or response to an agricultural disease or significant\ncyber incident, are performed by federal departments or agencies under their own authorities and\nfunding or through reciprocal mutual assistance agreements. Some federal departments or agencies\nhave authorities to declare specific types of disasters or emergencies and conduct or lead federal\nresponse actions using funding sources other than the Disaster Relief Fund. For example, specific trust\nfunds are established under federal environmental laws to support and fund oil and hazardous\nsubstances response operations. Similarly, federal land management agencies are required at all times\nto respond to incidents of all magnitudes that occur on or impact federal lands managed by those\nagencies, while federal departments and agencies acting under the trust doctrine can provide financial\nand programmatic support to tribes, when requested.\nWhen the Secretary of Homeland Security is not coordinating the overall response, federal departments\nand agencies may coordinate federal operations under their own statutory authorities or as designated\nby the President and may activate response structures applicable to those authorities. The head of the\ndepartment or agency may also request the Secretary of Homeland Security to activate NRF structures\nand elements (e.g. Incident Management Assistance Teams and National Operation Center elements)\nto provide additional assistance, while still retaining leadership for the response.\n33 These authorities may be exercised independently of, concurrently with, or become part of a federal response\ncoordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to Presidential directive.\n44"

In addition to Stafford Act support, the NRF or other\nsupplementary or complementary operational plans may be applied to respond or provide other forms\nof support. During a non-Stafford Act response:\n The President may designate, and departments and agencies may recommend through the\ninteragency policy process, an LFA to manage the incident.\n When an LFA is designated, the LFA appoints a senior response official to carry out its\nresponsibilities employing the NRF, NDRF, and NIMS. The senior response official is the Federal\nGovernment’s senior representative fully dedicated to the response, demonstrates national-level\nleadership in a time of crisis, and acts as the face and voice of the Federal response when interacting\nwith other senior Federal, state, tribal, territorial, or insular, private sector, nongovernmental, and\nelected officials as well as the media and the public.\n When directed by the President or requested by an agency head, FEMA’s incident management\ncapabilities may be used on a reimbursable basis under the Economy Act to support an LFA in\ncarrying out the aforementioned responsibilities. FEMA may adjust the scale of its support to\nensure execution of its statutory responsibilities.\nOperational Planning\nOperational planning is conducted across the whole community, including the private sector, NGOs,\nand all levels of government. Operational planning is guided by objectives and priorities identified in\nrelated strategic plans and an understanding of the risks that affect an organization or jurisdiction. The\nNRF fosters unity of effort for emergency operations planning by providing common doctrine and\npurpose, which integrates both the National Preparedness System and the National Planning System.\nPlanning is fundamental to national preparedness. Plans are a continuous, evolving instrument of\nanticipated actions that maximize opportunities and guide response operations. Because planning is an\nongoing process, a plan is a product based on information and understanding at the moment and is\nsubject to revision.\nThe National Planning System provides a unified approach and common terminology for deliberate\nand incident action planning. Deliberate planning involves developing strategic, operational, and\ntactical plans to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from a\njurisdiction’s threats or hazards. Incident action planning, sometimes referred to as crisis action\nplanning, occurs in a time-constrained environment to develop or rapidly adapt operational and tactical\nplans in response to an imminent or ongoing incident.38\nDeliberate plans provide the starting point for incident response and recovery and provide much of the\nrequired information for incident action planning, which is then adapted to meet operational conditions.\nThe planning process includes a feedback loop for continual refinement of deliberate and incident plans\nto more effectively address incident priorities and objectives. Incident plans are continually refined\n38 National Planning System, 2016, pages 4 and 5.\n47"

Incident plans can also support the\nmodification and improvement of deliberate plans through after-action and lessons-learned processes.\nResponse to emergencies and disasters will be most effective when communities conduct risk- and\ncapability-based planning. Support provided by the National Risk Management Center and tools such\nas the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment, Stakeholder Preparedness Review, and\nCore Capability Development Sheets help communities to set risk-based capability targets, evaluate\ncapability gaps, and develop strategies to build and sustain discrete capabilities. These activities inform\nresource investment and allocation, drive deliberate planning efforts focused on the most challenging\nrisks, and help government and private sector officials understand response and recovery capacities\nand identify where mutual aid or other assistance may fill capability gaps.\nThe National Planning System and Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 provide further\ninformation on the various types of plans and guidance on the fundamentals of planning.\nFederal Planning\nFederal planning is integrated to align, link, and synchronize response actions to enable federal\ndepartments and agencies and other national-level partners to provide the right resources at the right\ntime to support local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area government response operations.\nIntegrated planning provides answers for which traditional and nontraditional partners can deliver\ncapabilities that stabilize community lifelines and ultimately support the recovery of the community.\nThe NRF is based on the concept of tiered response with an understanding that most incidents start at\nthe local or tribal level, and as needs exceed resources and capabilities, additional local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, insular area, or federal assets may be required. The FIOP for response and recovery,\ntherefore, is intended to align with other local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area government, and\nfederal plans to ensure that all response partners share a common operational focus. Similarly,\nintegration occurs at the federal level among the departments, agencies, and nongovernmental partners\nthat compose the respective mission area through the frameworks, FIOPs, and departmental and agency\noperations plans.\nFigure 6 provides an overview of how federal deliberate planning efforts are aligned under the National\nPreparedness System and are mutually supportive in their development, coordination, and use.\nSimilarly, complementary and mutually supportive plans may be developed by organizations through\nincident action planning.\n48"

Continuity considerations should be incorporated into the planning process. Continuity is\nnot strictly a governmental responsibility, nor is it limited to a specific critical infrastructure sector.\nEffective continuity planning helps to ensure the uninterrupted ability to engage partners; to respond\nappropriately with scaled, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities; to specify succession to\noffice and delegations of authority to protect the unity of effort and command; and to account for the\navailability of responders, regardless of the threat or hazard.39\nEnsuring the continuity of community lifeline operations is a critical part of responding to a disaster.\nContinuity planning and operations increase the likelihood of uninterrupted coordination across\njurisdictions, levels of government, and the private sector, particularly during catastrophic incidents.\nFor example, effective response operations require the operability, interoperability, and continuity of\ncommunications. The National Emergency Communications Plan provides the whole community with\na strategic plan that establishes a shared vision for and coordinates the complex mission of maintaining\nand improving emergency communications capabilities.\nContinuity considerations, including community lifeline interdependencies, should be built into all\nplans and guidance and supported by leadership at all levels. Without the implementation of continuity\nprinciples, private sector organizations and governments at all levels may be unable to provide services\nand sustainment of community lifelines when needed the most.\nSupporting Resources\nTo assist NRF users, FEMA maintains electronic versions of the current NRF documents—the base\ndocument, ESF annexes, and support annexes—as well as other supporting materials. FEMA also\nprovides information, training materials, and other tools, such as an overview of the main Stafford Act\nprovisions, a guide to authorities and references, and an abbreviations list to assist response partners\nin understanding and executing their roles under the NRF. Materials are regularly evaluated, updated,\nand augmented, as necessary.

The NRF is built on scalable, flexible, and adaptable\nconcepts identified in the National Incident Management System (NIMS) to align key roles and\nresponsibilities across the Nation. The structures, roles, and responsibilities described in this\nFramework can be partially or fully implemented in the context of a threat or hazard, in anticipation of\na significant event, or in response to an incident. Implementation of the structures and procedures\ndescribed herein allows for a scaled response, delivery of specific resources and capabilities, and a\nlevel of coordination appropriate to each incident.\nResponding to disasters and emergencies requires the cooperation of a variety of organizations; the\nlarger or more complex the incident, the greater the number and variety of organizations that must\nrespond. Think of a residential fire: Firefighters are leading the charge; public works may be on scene\nproviding traffic control; police are providing security; emergency medical services personnel are\ntriaging, transporting, and redistributing injured to local hospitals; and a local nonprofit or voluntary\norganization (e.g., American Red Cross and Salvation Army) may be on hand to assist displaced\nresidents. For large disasters, such as major hurricanes or earthquakes, the incident complexity is\nincreased as others—such as states or tribes and, ultimately, the Federal Government—become\ninvolved. Businesses, voluntary organizations, and other elements of the private sector are also key\nstakeholders, providing the essential services that must be restored following an incident. The NRF\nprovides the foundation for how these organizations coordinate, integrate, and unify their response.\nThe unprecedented scale of recent disasters has spurred continued innovation in response operations\nand highlighted the need for further progress to build resilient capabilities to respond to disasters of\nincreasing frequency and magnitude. This fourth edition of the NRF embraces lessons-learned from\nthose disasters and shares emerging best practices.\nSince publication of the third edition of the NRF in 2016, disaster response operations have\nunderscored the paramount importance of sustaining essential community lifelines. The Framework\ndefines community lifelines as those services that enable the continuous operation of critical\ngovernment and business functions and are essential to human health and safety or economic security.\nIf disrupted, rapid stabilization of community lifelines is essential to restoring a sense of normalcy.\nRecent disasters have illuminated two underlying features of community lifelines that highlight\nopportunities to strengthen response planning and operations.\nFirst, community lifelines are interdependent and vulnerable to cascading failures. For example,\ncommunications and electric power systems rely on each other to function; severe damage to one will\ndisrupt the other. Most lifelines also rely on complex supply chains. Water and wastewater service\ndepend on the resupply of a broad array of chemicals and—if power goes out—fuel for emergency\ngenerators. However, in a severe natural or human-caused incident, those supply chains themselves\nmay be broken.\nSecond, community lifeline stabilization relies on businesses and infrastructure owners and operators\nwho have the expertise and primary responsibility for managing their systems in emergencies.\nAccordingly, new doctrine and coordination mechanisms are needed to enable the private sector to\nplay a larger, more comprehensive role in preparedness and response activities.\nThe NRF is structured to help jurisdictions, citizens, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and\nbusinesses develop whole community plans, integrate continuity plans, and build capabilities to\nrespond to cascading failures among businesses, supply chains, and infrastructure sectors, as well as\ncollaborate with the private sector and NGOs to stabilize community lifelines and enable restoration\nii\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nof services in severe incidents. Critical infrastructure sector leadership (sector-specific agencies,\ngovernment coordinating councils, and sector coordinating councils) create an established network to\ncollaborate with their respective private sector partners and support cross-sector1 response operations.\nOften, Emergency Support Functions (ESF) work with sector leadership to bolster preparedness for\ncross-sector collaboration. This fourth edition of the NRF describes new initiatives that leverage\nexisting networks and better integrate business interests and infrastructure owners and operators into\nthe heart of emergency management.\nThe NRF describes ways to improve coordination and response structures to build preparedness for\ncatastrophic incidents. Stabilizing community lifelines in catastrophic incidents is vital and\nextraordinarily difficult. Communities cannot meet these challenges solely by scaling up existing plans\nand capabilities. Rather, new mechanisms are needed to supplement and integrate those already in\nplace and facilitate cross-sector coordination, while respecting the roles of private sector partners and\nauthorities of agencies at all levels of government.\nA new ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure is introduced to focus on engaging private\nsector interests and infrastructure owners and operators—particularly those in sectors not currently\naligned to other ESFs—and conducting cross-sector analysis to help inform decision making. ESF #14\nrelies on other ESFs aligned with a critical infrastructure sector to continue coordination with their\ncorresponding sector during response efforts. ESF #14 helps coordinate multi-sector response\noperations between (or across) the government and private sector for natural or human-caused\ncatastrophic incidents that jeopardize national public health and safety, the economy, and national\nsecurity.\nThis edition of the Framework also builds on the response approach in previous editions to address\nnational security emergencies. The National Security Strategy of the United States of America notes\nthat potential adversaries are developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten U.S.\ncritical infrastructure.2 Adversaries may also strategically target attacks to exploit interdependencies\nbetween infrastructure sectors and magnify cascading failures between them, posing incident response\nchallenges above and beyond those created by earthquakes or other catastrophic natural hazards. The\ninitiatives in this Framework address the resulting challenges for consequence management in ways\nthat supplement and support other government, private sector, and NGO plans and coordinating\nstructures.\n1 Cross-sector operations are those actions taken by public and private sector organizations from one or more of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors to help entities or facilities associated with other sectors respond to an incident, being\nfocused on preventing or mitigating cascading failures between sectors and restoring critical supply chains.\n2 For more information on the National Security Strategy of the United States of America, see\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf.\niii\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................... 1\nEvolution of the Framework ...................................................................................................1\nFramework Purpose and Organization .................................................................................2\nScope..........................................................................................................................................3\nIntended Audience ...................................................................................................................5\nGuiding Principles ...................................................................................................................5\nFoundational Components ........................................................................................... 8\nPrioritized Stabilization of Community Lifelines .................................................................8\nNational Incident Management System ...............................................................................11\nCore Capabilities ....................................................................................................................12\nOperational Coordination ........................................................................................... 15\nPrivate Sector Engagement ...................................................................................................15\nLocally Executed Response ...................................................................................................16\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Managed Response ......................................18\nFederally Supported Response .............................................................................................19\nRoles and Responsibilities for Response ................................................................. 25\nCommunities ...........................................................................................................................26\nLocal Government .................................................................................................................29\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Government ..................................................30\nFederal Government ..............................................................................................................34\nFederal Authorities ...................................................................................................... 42\nFederal Response and Assistance Under the Robert T.

The National\nResponse Framework (NRF) sets the strategy and doctrine for how the whole community builds,\nsustains, and delivers the response core capabilities identified in the National Preparedness Goal in an\nintegrated manner with the other mission areas. The fourth edition of the NRF emphasizes enhancing\nthe unity of effort between the government and the private sector through better coordination and\ncollaboration.\nEvolution of the Framework\nThe NRF builds on over 25 years of federal response guidance, beginning with the Federal Response\nPlan, published in 1992, and the National Response Plan, published in 2004. This fourth edition of the\nNRF reorganizes and streamlines the previous version of the NRF, expands principles and\nconcepts to better integrate government and private sector response efforts, and introduces the\ncommunity lifelines concept and terminology.\nThis document supersedes the National Response Framework, Third Edition that was\nissued in June 2016 and becomes effective 60 days after publication.\nCommunity lifelines are those services that enable the continuous operation of critical government and\nbusiness functions and are essential to human health and safety or economic security. In serious but\npurely local incidents, interruptions of water service, electric power, and other community lifeline\ncomponents are typically brief and easy to mitigate. However, severe and widespread incidents can\nhalt lifeline services for many weeks or months. Such disruptions are especially extensive in\ncatastrophic incidents and may result in mass casualties and other cascading consequences.\nMaking community lifelines a core focus of incident response within the NRF offers unique benefits\nfor incidents ranging from small-scale to catastrophic disasters. By building capabilities to stabilize4\nand accelerate the restoration of community lifeline services, it will be possible to save countless lives,\nlimit damage to the economy, help maintain essential services for critical national security installations,\nreduce the initial impacts of disasters, and facilitate recovery operations. While the primary focus of\nincident response remains on stabilizing community lifelines, other secondary considerations regarding\nthe natural and cultural environment and economic factors are equally as important.\n3 Whole community includes individuals and communities, businesses, private and public sector owners and operators\nof critical infrastructure, faith-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, and all levels of government (local,\nregional/metropolitan, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal). Whole community is defined in the National\nPreparedness Goal as “a focus on enabling the participation in national preparedness activities of a wider range of\nplayers from the private sector, including nongovernmental organizations and the general public, in conjunction with\nthe participation of all levels of governmental in order to foster better coordination and working relationships.”\n4 Stabilization occurs when immediate threats to life and property are anticipated, resourced, and managed and basic\ncommunity lifeline services are provided to survivors.\n1\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nCommunity lifelines provide a valuable decision-making construct to integrate cross-sector5 response\noperations and reporting. Each lifeline depends on multiple infrastructure sectors, businesses, and\nsupply chains to function. Focusing on community lifelines allows emergency managers and their\npartners to account for these complex interdependencies and prioritize response operations to achieve\nhigh-impact, multi-sector benefits. The Framework describes how the resources and capabilities of the\nFederal Government support such operations, while the new Emergency Support Function (ESF) #14\n– Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex describes how it facilitates coordination and\ncollaboration with business and infrastructure owners and operators to provide assistance and integrate\nthe private sector's support during response, particularly for those sectors not currently aligned to other\nESFs. Additional detail on the community lifelines can be found in the Prioritized Stabilization of\nCommunity Lifelines section.\nFinally, the Framework’s focus on community lifelines necessitates deeper collaboration with the\nprivate sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGO). During the disasters of 2017 and 2018,\nindividual businesses and infrastructure owners and operators (including public and private sectors)\nforged innovative, collaborative relationships with government agencies to help prioritize and\naccelerate the stabilization of community lifeline services. The fourth edition of the NRF and ESF #14\n– Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex institutionalize their progress and build upon it in\nways that respect the authorities, responsibilities, and roles of all public, private, and NGO partners\nessential to incident response.\nFramework Purpose and Organization\nThe NRF is a guide to how the Nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies. The NRF is\nbuilt on scalable, flexible, and adaptable concepts identified in the National Incident Management\nSystem (NIMS) to align key roles and responsibilities across the Nation. The NRF describes specific\nauthorities and best practices for managing incidents that range from the serious but purely local to\nthose that are catastrophic and national in scope.\nWithin the NRF, the term “response” includes actions to save lives, protect property and the\nenvironment, stabilize the incident, and meet basic human needs following an incident. Response also\nincludes the execution of emergency plans and actions to enable recovery. The NRF describes doctrine\nfor managing all types of disasters or emergencies, regardless of scale, scope, and complexity. The\ngoals and objectives herein explain common response disciplines and processes that have been\ndeveloped at all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area,6 and federal) and have\nmatured over time.\nTo achieve the National Preparedness Goal, the objectives of the NRF are to do the following:\n Describe coordinating structures, as well as key roles and responsibilities for integrating\ncapabilities across the whole community, to support the efforts of governments, the private sector,\nand NGOs in responding to actual and potential incidents;\n Describe how unity of effort among public and private sectors, as well as NGOs, supports the\nstabilization of community lifelines and prioritized restoration of infrastructure during an incident\n5 Cross-sector operations are those actions taken by public and private sector organizations from one or more of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors to help entities or facilities associated with other sectors respond to an incident,\nfocused on preventing or mitigating cascading failures between sectors and restoring critical supply chains. These\noperations include measures taken by infrastructure owners and operators, businesses, and their government partners\nto account for cross-sector interdependencies in incident response operations.\n6 Per the Stafford Act, insular areas include Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Other statutes or departments and agencies may define the term “insular area” differently.\n2\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nand enables recovery, including the elements that support economic security, such as restoration\nof business operations and other commercial activities;\n Describe the steps needed to prepare for delivering the response core capabilities, including\ncapabilities brought through businesses and infrastructure owners and operators in an incident;\n Foster integration and coordination of activities for response actions; and\n Provide guidance through doctrine and establish the foundation for continued improvement of the\nResponse Federal Interagency Operational Plan (FIOP), its incident annexes, as well as\ndepartment and agency plans that implement the FIOP.\nThe NRF also advances progress under the National Security Strategy of the United States of America.\nThe Framework helps achieve the strategy’s first pillar: to “protect the American people, the homeland,\nand the American way of life.” To accomplish this goal, the strategy calls for initiatives to strengthen\nthe Nation’s ability to withstand and recover rapidly from attacks and natural disasters. The NRF is\nstructured to help achieve these goals by establishing a new federal ESF coordinating structure to help\nmitigate the impact of catastrophic incidents on community lifelines and account for the risk that\nadversaries will seek to complicate and disrupt U.S. response operations.\nThe NRF is composed of a base document, ESF annexes, and support annexes. The annexes provide\ndetailed information to assist with the implementation of the NRF.\n ESF annexes describe the federal coordinating structures that group resources and capabilities into\nfunctional areas most frequently needed in a national response.\n Support annexes describe other mechanisms by which support is organized among private sector,\nNGO, and federal partners. The support annexes describe the essential supporting processes and\nconsiderations common to most incidents. Content found within the support annexes is superseded\nby changes and updates to legislation. The support annexes include the following:\n− Financial management\n− International coordination\n− Public affairs\n− Tribal relations\n− Volunteer and donations management\n− Worker safety and health\nThe Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Support Annex and Private Sector Coordination Support\nAnnex, which supplemented previous versions of the NRF, have been superseded in this fourth edition\nof the NRF by ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure Annex, which has been added as\npart of this updated framework. All references to these support annexes within the ESF or support\nannexes should be read as referring to the ESF #14 – Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure.\nScope\nThe NRF is a framework for all types of threats and hazards, ranging from accidents, technological\nhazards, natural disasters, and human-caused incidents. This Framework is utilized to implement\nNIMS and describes whole community coordinating structures and response activities; in particular,\nthe Framework outlines government, private sector, and nongovernmental roles to reinforce\n3\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ncollaborative incident response.7 The NRF also describes the structure and mechanisms for national-\nlevel policy and operational direction for incident management to ensure timely and effective federal\nsupport to local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governmental activities and survivors. The\nNRF is applicable to all federal, local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area departments and agencies\nthat participate in operations requiring a coordinated federal response.\nNRF elements can be implemented at any time for any hazard, including the employment of ESF\nmechanisms. The structures, roles, and responsibilities described herein can be partially or fully\nimplemented in the context of a threat or hazard, in anticipation of a significant event, or in response\nto an incident. Implementation of NRF structures and procedures allows for a scaled response, delivery\nof the specific resources and capabilities, and a level of coordination appropriate to each incident.\nThe response mission area includes the capabilities necessary to stabilize an incident, save lives, protect\nproperty and the environment, meet basic human needs, restore community lifeline services and other\nbasic community functionality, and establish a safe and secure environment to facilitate the integration\nof recovery activities.\nIn this fourth edition of the NRF, the thresholds for catastrophic incident response may vary depending\non one’s perspective. A localized flood can be catastrophic to an individual family who lost their home\nand possessions, a severe tornado can be catastrophic to a town or city, and a hurricane can be\ncatastrophic to a state or territory. At the national level, a catastrophic incident8 is one of such extreme\nand remarkable severity or magnitude that the Nation’s collective capability to manage all response\nrequirements would be overwhelmed, thereby posing potential threats to national security, national\neconomic security, and/or the public health and safety of the Nation. A national catastrophic incident\nimplies that the necessary resources are not available within expected timeframes for incident response.\nDuring a national catastrophic incident, decision makers would be forced to consider the landscape of\nrequirements and prioritize resources to manage shortfalls rather than to address all needs at once. Such\na situation would also require the extraordinary means of mobilizing and prioritizing national resources\nto alleviate human suffering; protect lives and property; reduce damage to natural, cultural, and historic\nresources; stabilize the Nation’s economy; and ensure national security.\nIn this Framework, the term “incident” includes any occurrence, natural or manmade, that necessitates\na response to protect life or property and includes planned events, as well as emergencies or disasters\nof all kinds and sizes. The NRF’s structures and procedures address how federal departments and\nagencies coordinate support for local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments and how\ngovernment at all levels works in unity with private sector and NGOs.\nNothing in the NRF is intended to alter or impede the ability of a local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea government or Federal Government department or agency to carry out its authorities or meet its\nresponsibilities under applicable laws, Executive orders, and directives.\n7 The NRF must be consistent with all pertinent statutes and policies, particularly those involving privacy and civil\nand human rights, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Civil\nRights Act of 1964.\n8 The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 defines the term “catastrophic incident” as “any\nnatural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage\nor disruption severely affecting the population (including mass evacuations), infrastructure, environment, economy,\nnational morale, or government functions in an area.”\n4\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nIntended Audience\nThe NRF is intended to be used by communities; the private sector; NGOs; local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, and insular area governments; and the Federal Government, as well as other entities involved\nin response. The private sector includes for-profit and nonprofit organizations, formal and informal\nstructures, commerce, and industries that comprise the national economy and are not part of a\ngovernment structure. NGOs are a distinct category of organizations within the private sector that can\ninclude voluntary, ethnic, faith-based, veteran-based, disability,9 relief agency, and animal welfare\norganizations, among others, and are referenced separately. This all-inclusive whole community\napproach focuses efforts and enables a full range of stakeholders to participate in national preparedness\nactivities and to be full partners in incident response, including emergency management practitioners,\nfirst responders, and community leaders.\nInfrastructure owners and operators (in private and public sectors), and other elements of the private\nsector, are especially important partners for incident response and a key audience for the Framework.\nThese partners are vital for strengthening the coordination between industry and government that is\nnecessary to stabilize community lifelines after major incidents or events. They are also crucial partners\nfor creating the plans and doctrine to support essential functions for cross-sector response operations,\nespecially where their ability to volunteer capabilities and expertise provides vital (and in some cases\nirreplaceable) contributions to protecting public health and safety. Moreover, because catastrophic\nincidents will create far more requests for emergency resources and types of government assistance\nthan can be immediately fulfilled, infrastructure owners and operators and other commercial interests\ncan help government agencies establish objective, nationwide criteria to help inform the allocation of\nscarce resources to promote stabilization efforts, restore infrastructure, and to reduce morbidity and\nmortality.\nThe fourth edition of the NRF describes how the whole community contributes to and benefits from\nnational preparedness and integrated incident response. This includes children;10 older adults;\nindividuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs;11 those from religious, racial,\nand ethnically diverse backgrounds; people with limited English proficiency; and owners of animals,\nincluding household pets and service and assistance animals. Their individual contributions and needs\nmust be incorporated into response planning and delivery of the core capabilities. For further\ninformation, see the Core Capabilities section.\nGuiding Principles\nThe following principles establish fundamental doctrine for the response mission area to support\nlocally executed, state managed, and federally supported disaster operations: (1) engaged partnership;\n(2) tiered response; (3) scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities; (4) unity of effort\n9 An individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities (an\n“actual disability”) or a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity (“record\nof”) or an actual or perceived impairment, whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life\nactivity that is not both transitory and minor (“regarded as”). Individuals with disabilities have civil rights protections\nthat may not be waived under any circumstances, including throughout emergencies and disasters.\n10 Children require a unique set of considerations across the core capabilities contained within this document. Their\nneeds must be taken into consideration as part of any integrated planning effort.\n11 Access and functional needs refer to persons who may have additional needs before, during, and after an incident\nin functional areas, including but not limited to maintaining health, independence, communication, transportation,\nsupport, services, self-determination, and medical care. Individuals in need of additional response assistance may\ninclude those who have disabilities, live in institutionalized settings, are older adults, are children, are from diverse\ncultures, have limited English proficiency or are non-English speaking, or are transportation disadvantaged.\n5\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nthrough unified command; and (5) readiness to act. These principles are rooted in the federal system\nand the U.S. Constitution’s division of responsibilities between federal and state governments. These\nprinciples reflect the history of emergency management and the distilled wisdom of responders and\nleaders across the whole community.\nEngaged Partnership\nLocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments understand their needs best and play a\ncritical role in involving the whole community in preparing for and responding to disasters in order to\nmanage risk to communities and infrastructure.\nThose who lead emergency response efforts must communicate and support engagement with the\nwhole community by developing shared goals and aligning capabilities to reduce the scope and\nduration of impacts to any jurisdiction in times of crisis. Layered, mutually supporting capabilities of\nindividuals, communities, the private sector, NGOs, and governments at all levels allow for\ncoordinated planning in times of calm and effective response in times of crisis. Engaged partnership\nand coalition building include ongoing clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically\nappropriate communication to ensure an appropriate response. 12\nPartnership engagement entails continuous adaptation and improvements for incident preparedness and\ncontinuity of operations against all types of threats and hazards. The spectrum of viable threats is\nexpanding. Most notably, cyber threats to the Nation’s critical infrastructure and the community\nlifelines are intensifying. New challenges for incident response are also emerging. For example, in\nconjunction with cyberattacks, adversaries may spread false disaster reporting via social media and\nother means in order to incite panic and disrupt response operations. Thus, continuous engagement\nestablishing regular and clear communication between response partners is essential to ensuring that\naccurate, accessible, and actionable information and situational awareness is made available in\nresponse to these and other emerging threats.\nTiered Response\nMost incidents begin and end locally and are managed and executed at the local or tribal level. Incidents\nrequire a unified response from local agencies, the private sector, tribes, and NGOs. Some may require\nadditional support from neighboring jurisdictions or state governments. A smaller number of incidents\nrequire federal support.13 Incidents that occur within or along the borders of federally managed lands\nand state, tribal, and territorial lands require unity of effort among federal, state, tribal, or territorial\ngovernments at the local level. National response processes are structured to provide tiered levels of\nsupport when additional resources or capabilities are needed.\n12 Information, warnings, and communications associated with emergency management must ensure effective\ncommunication, such as through the use of appropriate auxiliary aids and services (e.g., interpreters, captioning, and\nalternative format documents) for individuals with disabilities and provide meaningful access to limited English-\nproficient individuals. Accessible messaging should be employed for individuals who use assistive technology and\nemploy non-technological means to reach those who do not have access to communication technology and those living\nin remote areas.\n13 Certain incidents such as a pandemic or cyberattack may not be limited to a specific geographic area and may be\nmanaged at the local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, or federal level, depending on the nature of the incident.\n6\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nWhen all levels of government become engaged, a response is federally supported, state managed, and\nlocally executed, with tribes, territories, and insular area governments often managing the response, as\nwell. The Federal Government’s support and response during disasters build on and are affected by the\ncapacity of state, tribal, territorial, insular, and local governments, as well as the business community\nand NGOs. Preparedness efforts with partners at all levels increase the effectiveness of tiered response.\nScalable, Flexible, and Adaptable Operational Capabilities\nAs incidents change in size, scope, and complexity, response efforts must adapt to meet evolving\nrequirements. The number, type, and sources of resources must be able to expand rapidly to meet the\nchanging needs associated with a given incident and its cascading effects. As needs grow and change,\nresponse processes must remain nimble, adaptable, and resilient. The structures and processes\ndescribed in the NRF must be able to apply resources from the whole community to support disaster\nsurvivors and stabilize the community. As incidents stabilize, response efforts must be flexible to\nfacilitate the integration of recovery activities.\nUnity of Effort Through Unified Command\nThe NIMS concept of unified command14 maximizes response efforts while integrating and respecting\nthe roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of all participating organizations. The Incident Command\nSystem (ICS), as prescribed by NIMS, is important to ensuring interoperability across\nmultijurisdictional or multiagency incident management activities. Unified command enables unity of\neffort when no single jurisdiction, agency, or organization has primary authority and/or the resources\nto manage an incident on its own. The use of unified command enables jurisdictions and those with\nauthority or responsibility for the incident to jointly manage and direct incident activities through\nestablishment of common incident objectives, strategies, and a single incident action plan. ICS is used\nby all levels of government, as well as by many NGOs and private sector organizations.\nReadiness To Act\nFrom individuals and communities to businesses, nonprofit, faith-based, and voluntary organizations\nand all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal), national response\ndepends on the ability to act decisively. A forward-leaning posture is imperative for incidents that may\nexpand rapidly in size, scope, or complexity, as well as incidents that occur without warning. Decisive\naction is often required to save lives and protect property and the environment. Although some risk to\nresponders may be unavoidable, all response personnel are responsible for anticipating and managing\nrisk through proper planning, organizing, equipping, training, and exercising.\n14 The ICS “unified command” concept is distinct from the military use of this term. Concepts of “command” and\n“unity of command” have distinct legal and cultural meanings for military forces and military operations. Military\nforces always remain under the control of the military chain of command and are subject to redirection or recall at any\ntime. Military forces do not operate under the command of the incident commander or under the unified command\nstructure, but they do coordinate with response partners and work toward a unity of effort while maintaining their\ninternal chain of command.\n7\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nPrior to and during catastrophic incidents or a national security emergency15, especially those that\noccur with little or no notice, the Federal Government may mobilize and deploy assets in anticipation\nof a formal request from the state, tribe, territory, insular area, or under existing federal response\nauthorities. Proactive efforts are intended to ensure that federal resources reach the scene in time to assist\nin reducing disruption of normal functions of local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments\nand are done in coordination and collaboration with the governments, private sector entities, and NGOs,\nwhen possible.\nFoundational Components\nPrioritized Stabilization of Community Lifelines\nStabilizing community lifelines is the primary effort during response to lessen threats and hazards to\npublic health and safety, the economy, and security. A community lifeline enables the continuous\noperation of critical government and business functions and is essential to human health and safety or\neconomic security. Together, the community lifelines reframe incident information to provide decision\nmakers with root cause and impact analysis. This construct maximizes the effectiveness of federally\nsupported, state managed, and locally executed response. Figure 1 identifies the seven community\nlifelines: Safety and Security; Food, Water, Shelter; Health and Medical; Energy (Power & Fuel);\nCommunications; Transportation; and Hazardous Material.\nFigure 1: Community Lifelines for Incident Stabilization\nThe seven community lifelines represent only the most basic services a community relies on and which,\nwhen stable, enable all other activity within a community. The lifelines are designed to enable\nemergency managers, infrastructure owners and operators, and other partners to analyze the root cause\nof an incident impact and then prioritize and deploy resources to effectively stabilize the lifeline. As\nexplained later in the NRF, ESFs deliver core capabilities to stabilize community lifelines for an\neffective response. Similar to the ESFs, other whole community organizations can work together to\nstabilize lifelines and meet disaster needs. The community lifelines do not directly cover all important\naspects of community life that can be affected by an incident, including impacts to natural, historical,\nand cultural resources. For example, financial and economic issues important to the life and safety of\naffected individuals may also arise indirectly from impacts to lifelines during an incident.\n15 National security emergency means any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological\nemergency, or other emergency, that seriously degrades or threatens the national security of the United States, as\ndefined in Executive Order 12656.\n8\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nExample of Impacts on Financial Services After a Community Lifeline Disruption\nA tornado has caused massive devastation in a rural town. Among the major impacts to\ncommunity lifelines is the community’s inability to access money.\n Power outages have kept several bank branches closed and automated teller\nmachines (ATM) inoperable, and merchants who are open despite the power outages\nare only able to accept cash transactions.\n Some merchants, ATMs, and bank branches are already open and have been\nenergized through grid or generator power. However, communications outages\nprevent them from accessing systems to process an electronic transaction.\n Transportation issues (road closures and blockages) limit survivors’ ability to travel to\nthe limited merchants, ATM locations, and bank branches in the area, as well as\nresponders’ ability to provide assets to stabilize critical infrastructure.\nThese cumulative effects, while incredibly disruptive to the community, are caused by a\nconfluence of impacts to specific lifelines. By using the community lifeline construct and\nroot cause analysis, emergency managers can assess that the major limiting factors\nrestricting community access to money are through the power, transportation, and\ncommunications lifelines. Accordingly, a local emergency manager may alleviate the\nsituation by considering options, such as prioritized route clearance for emergency access\nby power and communications crews, generators for temporary power, or deployment of\nmobile cell towers, for establishing connectivity until other infrastructure is restored.\nThe community lifelines are composed of multiple components that encompass infrastructure, assets,\nand services. Table 1 provides a brief description of each community lifeline but is not a comprehensive\nlist of all components that should be analyzed.\nTable 1: Community Lifeline Descriptions\nCommunity Lifeline Description\n• Law enforcement and government services, as well as the associated\nassets that maintain communal security, provide search and rescue,\nSafety and Security\nevacuations, and firefighting capabilities, and promote responder\nsafety.\n• Support systems that enable the sustainment of life, such as water\ntreatment, transmission, and distribution systems; food retail and\nFood, Water, Shelter\ndistribution networks; wastewater collection and treatment systems; as\nwell as sheltering, and agriculture.\n• Infrastructure and service providers for medical care, public health,\nHealth and Medical patient movement, fatality management, behavioral health, veterinary\nsupport, and health or medical supply chains.\n• Service providers for electric power infrastructure, composed of\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution systems, as well as gas and\nEnergy liquid fuel processing, transportation, and delivery systems. Disruptions\ncan have a limiting effect on the functionality of other community\nlifelines.\n• Infrastructure owners and operators of broadband Internet, cellular\nCommunications\nnetworks, landline telephony, cable services (to include undersea\n9\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nCommunity Lifeline Description\ncable), satellite communications services, and broadcast networks\n(radio and television). Communication systems encompass a large set\nof diverse modes of delivery and technologies, often intertwined but\nlargely operating independently. Services include elements such as\nalerts, warnings, and messages, as well as 911 and dispatch. Also\nincludes accessibility of financial services.\n• Multiple modes of transportation that often serve complementary\nfunctions and create redundancy, adding to the inherent resilience in\nTransportation overall transportation networks. Transportation infrastructure generally\nincludes highway/roadways, mass transit, railway, aviation, maritime,\npipeline, and intermodal systems.\n• Systems that mitigate threats to public health/welfare and the\nenvironment. This includes assessment of facilities that use, generate,\nHazardous Material and store hazardous substances, as well as specialized conveyance\nassets and efforts to identify, contain, and remove incident debris,\npollution, contaminants, oil or other hazardous substances.\nAs described in Table 1, community lifelines rely on multiple government entities, businesses, and\ninfrastructure sectors to function. As a result, response operations to stabilize a lifeline are unlikely to\nfit within a single department, agency, ESF, infrastructure sector, or industry. Moreover, because these\nsectors and the community lifelines they support are interdependent, failures in one will cascade across\nto others.\nAccounting for these interdependencies and their associated requirements for cross-sector assistance\nthey entail poses overarching challenges in building preparedness for complex incidents. The\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the sector-specific agencies, has\nidentified National Critical Functions16 that enable the Federal Government, in partnership with\ninfrastructure owners and operators, to improve the risk management process before and after an\nincident and can support community lifeline assessments and stabilization efforts.\nCommunity lifelines can be used by all levels of government, the private sector, and other partners to\nfacilitate operational coordination and drive outcome-based response. Figure 2 shows how community\nlifelines are applied to support decision-making.\nFigure 2: The Application of Community Lifelines to Support Emergency Management\n16 National Critical Functions are the functions of government and the private sector so vital to the United States that\ntheir disruption, corruption, or dysfunction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security,\nnational public health or safety, or any combination thereof.\n10\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nAfter an incident, initial assessments of the community lifelines (i.e., whether they are impacted and\nto what extent) help establish incident priorities and objectives that drive response actions.\nContinuously reassessing the status of community lifelines enables decision-makers to adjust\noperations in ways that can accelerate incident stabilization.\nUsing the community lifelines enables emergency managers and decision makers at all levels (e.g.,\nbusiness and infrastructure owners and operators, economic development agencies, comptrollers,\npublic health officials, and healthcare providers) to understand and assess impacts on a community,\nidentify limiting factors, and quickly develop solutions following an incident. Decision makers must\nrapidly determine the scope, complexity, and interdependent impacts of a disaster, so applying the\ncommunity lifeline construct will allow them to do the following:\n Prioritize, sequence, and focus response efforts toward maintaining or restoring the most critical\nservices and infrastructure;\n Utilize a common lexicon to facilitate communication across various stakeholders;\n Promote a response that facilitates unity of effort among the whole community (e.g., Federal\nGovernment; state, tribal, territorial, insular area, and local governments; and private sector and\nnongovernmental entities); and\n Clarify which components of the disaster are complex (emergent) and/or complicated (difficult),\nrequiring cross-sector coordination.\nResponse activities organized around the community lifelines allow local, state, tribal, territorial,\ninsular, and Federal Government emergency managers, along with private sector and nongovernmental\npartners, to better align, sequence, and prioritize limited public and private sector resources. The intent\nis to efficiently stabilize the incident by anticipating, resourcing, and managing immediate threats to\nlife and property and to set the conditions for longer-term infrastructure restoration and economic and\ncommunity recovery. Community lifeline stabilization is not the end state in itself for incident response\nand recovery, but a construct to achieve efficacy and efficiency throughout the disaster response phase.\nNational Incident Management System\nThe purpose of NIMS is to provide a common approach to managing incidents. NIMS concepts provide\nfor standardized but flexible incident management and support practices that emphasize common\nprinciples, a consistent approach for operational structures and supporting mechanisms, and an\nintegrated approach to resource management. The response protocols and structures described in the\nNRF align with NIMS. NIMS provides the template for the management of incidents, regardless of\nsize, scope, cause, or complexity, while the NRF provides the structure and mechanisms for policy\nimplementation and incident response. Standardizing national response doctrine on NIMS integrates\nthe capabilities and resources of various governmental jurisdictions, incident management and\nemergency response disciplines, NGOs, and the private sector into a cohesive, coordinated, and\nseamless national framework for incident response.\nAll of the components of NIMS—resource management, command and coordination, and\ncommunications and information management—support response. The NIMS concept of unified\ncommand is described in the command and coordination component of NIMS. This concept is essential\nto effective response operations because it addresses the importance of (1) developing a single set of\nobjectives; (2) using a collective, strategic approach; (3) improving information flow and coordination;\n(4) creating a common understanding of joint priorities and limitations; (5) ensuring that no agency’s\nlegal authorities are compromised or neglected; and (6) optimizing the combined efforts of all\nparticipants under a single plan.\n11\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nMutual Aid\nCommunities apply NIMS principles to integrate response plans and resources across jurisdictions,\ndepartments, the private sector, and NGOs. Various public and private mutual aid systems can be\nleveraged. Neighboring communities or organizations play a key role by providing support through a\nnetwork of mutual aid and assistance agreements that identify the resources that communities may\nshare during an incident. Additionally, private sector organizations often establish mutual aid\nagreements with each other to increase capabilities and expedite their response.\nThe ability to provide mutual aid accurately and rapidly is critical during disasters, but mutual aid\npartners require a common language and process to support the sharing of qualified personnel. The\nNational Qualification System (NQS) addresses this challenge by providing a common language and\napproach for qualifying, certifying, and credentialing incident management and support personnel.\nNQS provides the tools for jurisdictions and organizations to share resources seamlessly. Using the\nNQS approach helps to ensure personnel deploying through mutual aid agreements and compacts have\nthe required capabilities to perform their assigned duties.17\nCore Capabilities\nEach mission area—prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery—identifies core\ncapabilities required to address common threats and hazards. Using the core capabilities construct\nenables communities and organizations to focus on specific preparedness measures necessary to ensure\nthat the capabilities are available when needed. By allowing communities and organizations to quantify\nresponse requirements and measure response capacity, core capabilities are the key performance\nmanagement tool in emergency preparedness.18\nThe National Preparedness Goal describes the core capabilities necessary to be prepared for all threats\nand hazards. The core capabilities provide a common vocabulary describing the significant functions\nthat must be maintained and executed across the whole community to achieve the goal of a “secure\nand resilient nation.”\nPrevention: Avoiding, preventing, or stopping a threatened or actual act of terrorism.\nWithin the context of national preparedness, the term “prevention” refers to dealing with\nimminent threats.\nProtection: Securing the homeland against acts of terrorism and human-caused or natural\ndisasters.\nMitigation: Reducing loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.\nResponse: Saving lives, stabilizing community lifelines, protecting property and the\nenvironment, and meeting basic human needs after an incident has occurred.\nRecovery: Assisting impacted communities with restoration and revitalization.\nThe response core capabilities are the activities that generally must be accomplished in incident\nresponse, regardless of which levels of government are involved. While core capabilities are organized\nby mission area, they do not operate exclusively within that mission area. Actions related to one core\ncapability often can inform actions associated with another.\n17 For more information on NQS, see https://www.fema.gov/national-qualification-system; for more information on\nNQS typing tools, see https://rtlt.preptoolkit.fema.gov/Public/Combined.\n18 For a full list of the core capabilities, see https://www.fema.gov/core-capabilities.\n12\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nCommunity Lifeline Stabilization and the Core Capabilities\nCore capabilities are used to organize, analyze, and build the functions and services needed in response.\nThe core capabilities developed during the preparedness cycle are applied throughout response to\nstabilize community lifelines and enable recovery.\nBy engaging the whole community to build and deliver the response core capabilities, the Nation is\nbetter prepared to respond to a threat or hazard; to assist in restoring basic services, community\nfunctionality, and economic activity; and to facilitate the integration of recovery activities. Table 2\nshows how response core capabilities may relate to the community lifelines.\nTable 2: Examples of a Steady-State Relationship Between Community Lifelines and Response\nCore Capabilities\nCommunity Lifeline* Related Response Core Capabilities**\n• On-scene Security, Protection, and Law Enforcement\n• Fire Management and Suppression\n• Mass Search and Rescue Operations\nSafety and Security\n• Public Health, Healthcare, and Emergency Medical\nServices\n• Environmental Response/Health and Safety\n13\nInfrastructure\nSystems\nSituational\nAssessment\nOperational\nCoordination\nPublic\nInformation\nand\nWarning\nPlanning\n• Mass Care Services\nFood, Water, Shelter • Logistics and Supply Chain Management\n• Public Health, Healthcare, and Emergency Medical\nServices\n• Fatality Management Services\nHealth and Medical\n• Environmental Response/Health and Safety\n• Logistics and Supply Chain Management\n• Mass Care Services\nEnergy (Power & • Logistics and Supply Chain Management\nFuel)\n• Operational Communications\nCommunications\n• Public Information and Warning\nTransportation • Critical Transportation\nHazardous Material • Environmental Response/Health and Safety\n* Community Lifelines: How emergency managers assess and prioritize employment of capabilities for\nstabilization.\n** Core Capabilities: An interoperable means to characterize capabilities that may be assessed, built, or validated\nduring preparedness or applied to response operations.\nIntegration Among Mission Areas\nPotential points of intersection between the response mission area and other mission areas include the\nfollowing:\nPrevention. Response organizations coordinate with those responsible for preventing imminent acts\nof terrorism or an attack (e.g., a significant cyber incident causing cascading and/or physical impacts)\nto understand both potential and specific threats and to prepare accordingly by creating plans for\ngeneral threats and crisis action plans for credible threats.\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n When an incident may have been caused by an intentional act, response organizations coordinate\nclosely with law enforcement agencies to attribute the cause and prevent additional follow-on\ninstances.\n Response agencies coordinate with law enforcement agencies to enable themselves to prepare,\ntrain, stage, and plan for the delivery of consequence management capabilities.\n Response agencies must coordinate with the owners of properties impacted by a particular incident\nwho have the first responsibility for prevention, protection, and response.\nProtection. Protection of critical infrastructure systems and implementation of plans for the rapid\nrestoration of commercial activities and critical infrastructure operations are crucial aspects of the\nprotection mission area. Many of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors19 within the protection mission\narea are also represented in the response mission area. The existing infrastructure plans and\ncoordination mechanisms (e.g., sector-specific agencies and councils) provide strong foundations for\nstrengthening incident response plans and capabilities. As part of the National Infrastructure Protection\nPlan, public and private sector partners in each of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors and agencies at\nall levels of government have developed and maintain sector-specific plans that focus on the unique\noperating conditions and risk landscape within that sector.\n Response agencies should utilize the sector coordination constructs (e.g., sector-specific agencies\nor sector coordinating councils) to elicit advice and recommendations regarding systemic\nvulnerabilities, cross-sector interdependencies, and sector-level challenges that could hinder\nrestoration.\n Impacts to infrastructure may result in the need for consequence management (e.g., cyberattacks).\nMitigation. Effective mitigation efforts directly limit the impact of an emergency, disaster, or attack\non community lifelines and systems, thereby reducing the required scale of response capabilities\nneeded for an incident. The National Mitigation Investment Strategy recommends actions for all\nnational stakeholders involved in disaster resilience to reduce risks to and impacts on lifelines,\nbuildings, infrastructure, ecosystems, and cultural, historic, and natural resources. Planning, response,\nand regulatory organizations coordinate to reduce risks to critical infrastructure by evaluating potential\nthreats, encouraging resiliency in infrastructure, and planning for redundancy in services. These\norganizations often have information and the data about hazards and risks that can be shared with\nresponse personnel to improve response planning and execution.\n Response operations should leverage those organizations with relevant risk management equities\nto ascertain threats and hazards, understand vulnerabilities, and predict lifeline and survivor\nimpacts or needs to enable more expedient response operations.\n Opportunities to lessen the risks of future hazards are an important element to building national\nresilience.\nRecovery. As response activities are underway, recovery operations must begin. Applying the\ncommunity lifelines construct enables response officials to more effectively identify the requirements\nand sequence steps in the recovery process, including activities that support the economy, by focusing\nthem on vital areas of community support. This includes providing essential public health and safety\nservices; restoring interrupted utility and other essential services; reestablishing transportation routes\nand other infrastructure (e.g., agriculture), providing food, water, and shelter for those displaced by an\nincident; protecting natural and cultural resources and ensuring environmental compliance; ensuring\n19 The critical infrastructure sectors are described in the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan,\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/national-infrastructure-protection-plan-2013-508.pdf.\n14\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nequal access to services in accordance with applicable laws; reunifying children, adults, and household\npets who have been separated from their families/guardians; and reopening schools and child care\ncenters.\n Response organizations are responsible for setting the conditions that foster a quick and seamless\nintegration of recovery operations and establish conditions that enable a community’s recovery.\n Effective recovery support also depends on successful information sharing between the ESFs and\nthe six Recovery Support Functions (RSF) under the National Disaster Recovery Framework\n(NDRF).\n Recovery programs—including sheltering and housing, volunteer organization coordination,\ndonations management, small business and agriculture assistance or loans, as well as other disaster\nassistance—often support response and recovery objectives.\nThese overlapping areas are identified through comprehensive planning with the whole community to\nensure they are properly addressed during the response to an incident. Ensuring that operational plans\nproperly account for the integration of all mission areas is essential.\nOperational Coordination\nIncident management begins and ends locally, and most incidents are managed or executed at the\nclosest possible geographical, organizational, and jurisdictional levels. Successful incident\nmanagement often depends on the cooperation of multiple jurisdictions, levels of government,\nfunctional agencies, NGOs and emergency responder disciplines, and the private sector, which requires\neffective coordination across a broad spectrum of activities and organizations. Accordingly, the\noptimal disaster response follows the model of being locally executed; state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea managed; and federally supported with private sector and NGO engagement throughout.\nOperational coordination occurs across all of these levels and consists of actions and activities that\nenable decision makers to determine appropriate courses of action and provide oversight for all types\nof incidents, including complex homeland security operations, to achieve unity of effort and effective\noutcomes.\nPrivate Sector Engagement\nPublic sector government resources alone cannot provide all the solutions when responding to\nincidents. Acting within regulatory and authoritative guidelines, government entities and the private\nsector can provide mutually beneficial incident-specific response support. When government, private\nsector, and NGO resources are mutually supportive and aligned, there is a much better chance of\nmeeting communities’ incident and economic recovery needs. All elements of the community should\nbe activated, engaged, and integrated to respond to a major or catastrophic incident. This all-inclusive\napproach helps expand and expedite the availability of resources, capabilities, and solution sets for\nincident response. When severe incidents disrupt community lifelines, private sector and NGO\ncapabilities can assist with stabilizing lifelines and restoring services. Similar to public sector mutual\naid and support agreements, it is essential that government and private sector organizations engage in\ncollaboration before an incident to effectively partner during incident response.\nBusinesses and infrastructure owners and operators have primary responsibility for operating and\nrepairing their systems in emergencies. Businesses and infrastructure owners and operators also have\nunique expertise and capabilities to conduct restoration operations of their own systems, execute\nvoluntary mutual assistance operations within their sectors, and provide valuable resources for cross-\n15\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nsector support. When catastrophic incidents put a premium on the restoration of complex supply chains\n(especially for essential products and services needed for response efforts and stabilizing the economy),\nprivate sector coordination and assets are vital for public health and safety, the economy, and national\nsecurity. The private sector can also help government agencies prioritize support missions (e.g., debris\nremoval) to facilitate business and infrastructure response operations.\nIn coordination with local governments, private sector organizations have a critical role in re-\nestablishing commercial activities and restoring critical infrastructure operations the community\nrequires following a disruption. The resilience of private sector organizations directly affects\ncommunity recovery by providing products and services, employment opportunities, other resources\nand re-establishing a functioning economy. In many cases, private sector organizations also have\nimmediate access to commodities and services that support incident response.\nGovernmental response organizations should coordinate closely with private sector partners to do the\nfollowing:\n Assess cross-sector interdependencies and obstacles to meeting survivor needs;\n Identify opportunities to enable or support prompt stabilization of community lifelines;\n Identify where government support is appropriate and available; and\n Identify opportunities to synchronize response operations with private sector efforts to ensure the\nmost effective approach to reach as many survivors as possible.\nPrivate Sector Coordinating Structures\nCoordinating structures for the private sector include business emergency operations centers (BEOC),\nindustry trade groups and coordinating councils, information sharing and analysis centers, private\nsector information and intelligence centers, and other structural entities, such as healthcare coalitions.\nThese organizations, composed of multiple businesses and entities brought together by shared\ngeography or common function (e.g., banking, supply chain management, transportation, venue, and\nmanagement), support the collaboration, communication, and sharing of information within the private\nsector. Such organizations can coordinate with and support NGOs and, in many cases, serve as a\nconduit to government coordinating structures. Strengthening the relationship between private sector\nand government coordinating structures enhances information sharing and operational response.\nLocally Executed Response\nDuring a disaster, those closest to the impacted areas—individuals, families, neighbors, businesses,\nand emergency responders comprising the community—are the first ones active in response. Local\npartners know their community’s needs, capabilities, and resources best and are positioned to have the\nmost effective impact in the aftermath of an incident. Locally executed response focuses on how the\ncomplex network of local, voluntary, and private sector organizations integrate their capabilities to\nrestore damaged infrastructure, restart the flow of products and services, and place essential items into\nthe hands of survivors. Local governments and communities, therefore, provide the true operational\ncoordination for executing an effective response and can draw on the support of additional state and\nfederal resources when their own resources prove insufficient.\nEmergency responders at all levels of government use NIMS and ICS command and coordinating\nstructures to manage and support response operations (Figure 3). ICS is a management system designed\nto integrate on-scene facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications within a\ncommon organizational structure. Emergency operations centers (EOC) are facilities where staff\n16\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ncoordinate information and resources to support on-scene incident management. Staff in EOCs at all\nlevels of government may also encourage participation by the private sector, including NGOs,\nacademia, associations, and access and functional needs community organizations. Staff in EOCs at\nall levels of government may also encourage participation by private sector elements including NGOs,\nacademia, associations, and organizations representing those with disabilities and others with access\nand functional needs.\nAt the local level, coordinating structures are usually composed of entities within specific functional\nareas, such as public works, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and fire departments. On-\nscene integration among these structures may occur at incident command posts (ICP) and more\nfrequently at one or more local EOCs.\nFigure 3: Example of an ICS organization with a Single Incident Commander20\nIncident management may also involve Multiagency Coordination Groups (MAC Groups). A MAC\nGroup is composed of senior officials, such as agency administrators, executives, or their designees,\nwho are authorized to represent or commit agency resources and funds in support of incident activities.\nA MAC Group acts as an executive- or policy-level body during incidents, supporting resource\nprioritization and allocation, and enabling decision making among elected and appointed officials and\nthose responsible for managing the incident (i.e., the incident commander). In some communities and\njurisdictions, MAC Groups are located at or near EOCs in order to authorize additional resources,\napprove emergency authorities, and provide guidance on issues.\nLocal Coordinating Structures\nLocal jurisdictions and states employ a variety of coordinating structures to help identify risks,\nestablish relationships, and organize and build capabilities. Due to the unique partnerships, geographic\nconditions, threats, and capabilities, the coordinating structures vary. Examples of local response\n20 For more information on NIMS and ICS, see https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1508151197225-\nced8c60378c3936adb92c1a3ee6f6564/FINAL_NIMS_2017.pdf.\n17\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ncoordinating structures include local planning committees, healthcare coalitions,21 Community\nEmergency Response Teams (CERT), and chapters of national-level associations. These local and\nregional coordinating structures organize and integrate their capabilities and resources with\nneighboring jurisdictions, the state, the private sector, and NGOs.\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Managed Response\nState governments serve as agents for local jurisdictions by managing the delivery of federal disaster\nassistance to meet local requirements. While the local incident command structure directs on-scene\nincident management activities and maintains command and control of on-scene incident operations,\nstate EOCs are activated as necessary to support local EOCs and to help ensure that responders have\nthe resources they need to conduct response activities. This is achieved through integration of state-\nlevel coordinating structures working with local coordinating structures or the local incident command\nstructure.\nState, tribal, territorial, and insular area EOCs also provide a common location for coordination of\nstate/tribal/territorial/insular area—and in some cases, federal—support to local EOCs and/or incident\npersonnel. Most states, tribal organizations, territories, and insular areas maintain an EOC to manage\nincidents requiring state-level assistance. Some of these governments have additional EOCs for\ncoordinating information and resources within a region or area.\nMany states involve their tribal counterparts within the EOC to ensure that tribal coordinating\nstructures are integrated into the delivery of capabilities and tribal needs are addressed.\nState, Territorial, and Insular Area Coordinating Structures\nStates, territories, and insular areas also leverage the capabilities and resources of partners across the\nstate/territory/insular area when identifying needs and building capabilities. The coordinating\nstructures at the state, territorial, or insular area level also vary, depending on factors such as\ngeography, population, industry, and the capabilities of the local jurisdictions. These structures are also\ndesigned to leverage appropriate representatives from across the whole community, some of whom\nmay also participate in local or regional coordinating structures. Many states, territories, and insular\nareas create independent committees or councils focused on specific areas or functions as a sub-set of\ntheir emergency management agency.\nTribal Managed Response\nThe United States has a trust responsibility with federally recognized Indian tribes and recognizes their\nright to self-government. This trust doctrine requires the Federal Government to protect tribal treaty\nrights, lands, assets, and resources while providing support through statutory authority and other\nprograms. Under the Stafford Act, federally recognized Indian tribes may directly request their own\nemergency and major declaration or they may request assistance under a state request. In addition,\nfederally recognized Indian tribes can request federal assistance for incidents that impact the tribe but\ndo not result in a Stafford Act declaration. Given their unique position, tribal governments often have\nplanning and response requirements that are the equivalent of state and local operational coordination\nduring an incident.\n21 Healthcare coalitions are multi-agency coordination groups that integrate member organizations with the\njurisdictional agency(s) in the geographic area in which they operate. Healthcare coalitions are invaluable as public-\nprivate partnerships integrating healthcare facilities with emergency medical services, public health, and emergency\nmanagement.\n18\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nTribal Coordinating Structures\nTribal coordinating structures vary depending on a variety of factors, such as individual tribal\ncapabilities, population size, and economic circumstances. Tribes may have internal coordinating\nstructures and facilities for incident response, as well as others that include bordering states and\nneighboring jurisdictions.\nThe Tribal Assistance Coordination Group (TAC-G) is a MAC Group that assists federally recognized\ntribes during emergencies and disasters and provides information and technical assistance for tribal\nemergency management programs in coordination with federal partners. The TAC-G is led and\nmanaged by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Emergency Management Program. The TAC-G consists of\npartners from all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial, insular, or federal), as well as\nnonprofit aid organizations and the private sector.\nFederally Supported Response\nFederal support during response operations focuses on the capabilities necessary to save lives; protect\nproperty and the environment; meet basic human needs; prioritize operations to stabilize community\nlifelines and restore basic services and community functionality; establish a safe, secure, and accessible\nenvironment for responders and response operations; and support the transition to recovery. The\ndesired end-state for federal incident response is achieved when local, state, tribal, territorial, and\ninsular area entities no longer require Federal Government assistance to provide life-saving or life-\nsustaining support, thereby allowing for the transition to recovery.\nWhen an incident occurs that exceeds or is anticipated to exceed local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular\narea resources or when an incident is managed by federal departments or agencies acting under their\nown authorities, the Federal Government may use the management structures described within the\nNRF. Additionally, the Federal Government may use supplementary or complementary plans to\ninvolve all necessary department and agency resources to organize the federal response and ensure\ncoordination among all response partners.\nDifferent federal departments and agencies may play significant roles in response activities, depending\non the nature and size of an incident. Many of the arrangements by which departments and agencies\nparticipate are defined in the ESF annexes coordinated through pre-scripted mission assignments in a\nStafford Act response, formalized in interagency agreements, or described in supplementary plans.\nThe following sections describe federal support operations at the incident, regional, and headquarters\nlevels.\nFederal Incident-level Operations\nTo help deliver federal support or response at the incident level, coordinating structures are aligned to\nincident-level structures.\nUnified Coordination\nUnified coordination is the term used to describe the primary state/tribal/territorial/insular area/federal\nincident management activities conducted at the incident level. Unified coordination is typically\ndirected from a Joint Field Office (JFO), a temporary federal facility that provides a central location\nfor coordination of response efforts by the private sector, NGOs, and all levels of government. Unified\ncoordination is organized, staffed, and managed in a manner consistent with NIMS principles using an\nICS structure. The Unified Coordination Group (UCG) is composed of senior leaders representing\nstate, tribal, territorial, insular area and federal interests and, in certain circumstances, local\n19\n\n\nNational Response Framework\njurisdictions, the private sector, and NGOs. UCG members must have significant jurisdictional\nresponsibility and authority. The composition of the UCG varies from incident to incident, depending\non the scope and nature of the disaster. The UCG leads the unified coordination staff. Personnel from\nstate, tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal departments and agencies; other jurisdictional entities;\nthe private sector; and NGOs may be assigned to the unified coordination staff at various incident\nfacilities (e.g., JFOs, staging areas, and other field offices). The UCG determines staffing of the unified\ncoordination staff based on incident requirements.\nAlthough unified coordination is based on the ICS structure, it does not manage on-scene operations.\nInstead, unified coordination supports on-scene response efforts and conducts broader support\noperations that may extend beyond the incident site. Unified coordination must include robust\noperations, planning, public information, and logistics capabilities that integrate local, state, and\nfederal—as well as tribal, territorial, and insular area governments—personnel, when appropriate, so\nthat all levels of government work together to achieve unity of effort.\nWhen incidents affect multiple localities and states or the entire Nation, multiple UCGs with associated\nunified coordination staff may be established. In these situations, coordination occurs according to the\nprinciples of area command, as described in NIMS.\nAs the primary field entity for federal response, unified coordination integrates diverse federal\nauthorities and capabilities and coordinates federal response and recovery operations. Figure 4 shows\na unified coordination organization that might be assembled to deal with a major incident—such as a\nterrorist attack—that includes a law enforcement dimension. Federal agencies that conduct on-scene,\ntactical-level activities may also establish incident and area command structures, generally in\nconjunction with their counterpart local, state, tribal, territorial and/or insular area government\nagencies, to manage that work.\nFigure 4: Unified Coordination\n20\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nEmergency Support Functions as a Coordinating Structure\nESFs are the primary, but not exclusive, response coordinating structures at the federal level.\nCommunities, states, regions, and other tribal, territorial, insular area, and federal departments and\nagencies may use the ESF construct, or they may employ other coordinating structures or partners\nappropriate to their location, threats, or authorities. Whatever structures are used, they are encouraged\nto work closely with federal ESFs at the incident, regional, or headquarters levels if they are activated.\nThe Federal Government and many state governments organize their response resources and\ncapabilities under the ESF construct. Each ESF is composed of a department or agency that has been\ndesignated as the ESF coordinator, along with a number of primary and support agencies. Primary\nagencies are designated on the basis of their authorities, resources, and capabilities. Support agencies\nare assigned based on resources or capabilities in a given functional area. To the extent possible,\nresources provided by the ESFs are identified consistently with NIMS resource typing categories.\nESFs have proven to be an effective way to organize and manage resources to deliver core capabilities.\nThe federal ESFs are the primary, but not exclusive, federal coordinating structures for building,\nsustaining, and delivering the response core capabilities.\nAt the federal level, ESFs are groups of organizations that work together to deliver core capabilities to\nstabilize community lifelines in support of an effective response. Any ESF may assist in the delivery\nof a response core capability. Because a core capability may be required, each ESF can contribute to\nthe stabilization of any of the community lifelines, depending on the circumstances of the incident.\nTable 3 provides an example of actions each ESF may take to support incident issues arising within\nthe health and medical lifeline; these actions may impact more than one of the other community\nlifelines.\nTable 3: Example Actions That an ESF May Take in Support of Stabilizing the Health and Medical\nLifeline During Incident Response Operations\nESF Example Supporting Actions or Capabilities\nCoordinate the opening of roads and manage aviation airspace for\nESF #1 Transportation\naccess to health and medical facilities or services.\nProvide and enable contingency communications required at health and\nESF #2 Communications\nmedical facilities.\nESF #3 Public Works & Install generators and provide other temporary emergency power\nEngineering sources for health and medical facilities.\nCoordinates federal firefighting activities and supports resource\nESF #4 Firefighting\nrequests for public health and medical facilities and teams.\nESF #5 Information & Develop coordinated interagency crisis action plans addressing health\nPlanning and medical issues.\nESF #6 Mass Care,\nIntegrate voluntary agency and other partner support, including other\nEmergency Assistance,\nfederal agencies and the private sector, to resource health and medical\nTemporary Housing, &\nservices and supplies.\nHuman Assistance\nProvide logistics support for moving meals, water, or other\nESF #7 Logistics\ncommodities.\nESF #8 Public Health & Provide health and medical support to communities, and coordinate\nMedical Services across capabilities of partner agencies.\nESF #9 Search & Rescue Conduct initial health and medical needs assessments.\n21\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nESF Example Supporting Actions or Capabilities\nESF #10 Oil & Hazardous Monitor air quality near health and medical facilities in close proximity to\nMaterials Response the incident area.\nESF #11 Agriculture & Coordinate with health and medical entities to address incidents of\nNatural Resources zoonotic disease.\nCoordinate power restoration efforts for health and medical facilities or\nESF #12 Energy\npower-dependent medical populations.\nESF #13 Public Safety & Provide public safety needed security at health and medical facilities or\nSecurity mobile teams delivering services.\nBe informed of and assess cascading impacts of health or medical\nESF #14 Cross-Sector\ninfrastructure or service disruptions, and deconflict or prioritize cross-\nBusiness and Infrastructure\nsector requirements.\nConduct public messaging on the status of available health and medical\nESF #15 External Affairs\nservices or public health risks.\nAdditional detail on the scope of each ESF can be found in the Emergency Support Function Roles and\nResponsibilities section.\nAs previously noted, many local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area jurisdictions have adopted\nand tailored the ESF construct. Because these jurisdictions established ESFs based on their specific\nrisks and requirements, there is no mandatory or direct linkage to the federal ESFs. Governments are\nencouraged to engage members of the whole community as part of whatever coordinating processes\nthey use.\nDepartments and agencies supporting federal ESFs may be selectively activated by FEMA or as\nrequested by a lead federal agency to support response activities for incidents. Not all incidents\nrequiring federal support result in the activation of ESFs.\nWhen departments and agencies supporting federal ESFs are activated, they may assign staff at\nheadquarters, regional, and incident levels. Through the Stafford Act and in accordance with 6 U.S.C.\nSections 741(4) and 753(c), FEMA may issue mission assignments to obtain resources and services\nfrom federal departments and agencies.\nIncidents Without a Stafford Act Declaration\nMost incidents where the NRF serves as the foundational federal response doctrine will not result in a\nfederally declared disaster under the Stafford Act. For example, pre-incident operations for hurricanes,\nresponses to biological incidents, electric grid emergencies, oil spills, migration crises, public health\nemergencies, and a host of other threats and hazards may not receive a Presidential disaster declaration\nbut still require a coordinated national response.\nFor such non-Stafford Act incidents where the Federal Government is involved, the President may\ndesignate or the federal agencies involved may agree to recognize an agency to serve as the Lead\nFederal Agency (LFA) for the response. The LFA typically activates the response structures\nappropriate to its authorities. The LFA employs NIMS and this Framework to coordinate the federal\nresponse. Details regarding federal operations for non-Stafford incidents are contained within the\nrelevant statutes and policies. Because the NRF is always in effect, ESFs may be activated and\ndeployed to help manage any response in support of the LFA.\n22\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFederal Regional Operational Support\nCoordinating structures can be assembled and organized at the regional level to address incidents that\ncross state or international borders or have broad geographic or system-wide implications or to manage\ncompeting requirements for response assets among multiple incidents.\nFederal Regional Facilities\nMost federal departments and agencies have regional or field offices that may participate with local,\nstate, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments in planning for incidents and provide response\nassets when an incident occurs in their jurisdiction. Some federal departments and agencies share the\nsame standard federal regional structure as FEMA. In larger-scale incidents, these regional and field\noffices may provide the initial response assets with additional support being provided from other\ndepartment and agency offices across the Nation. Some federal regional and field offices have their\nown EOCs to support deployments of their assets.\n FEMA Regional Response Coordination Center (RRCC). FEMA has 10 regional offices, each\nheaded by a Regional Administrator. Each of FEMA’s regional offices maintains an RRCC. When\nactivated, RRCCs are multi-agency coordination centers generally staffed by regional FEMA\npersonnel and augmented by ESFs and other federal agencies in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing an incident. Operating under the direction of the FEMA Regional Administrator, the\nstaff within the RRCCs coordinates federal regional response efforts and maintains connectivity\nwith FEMA Headquarters and with state EOCs, state and major urban area fusion centers, Federal\nExecutive Boards, tribal governments, and other federal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\noperations and coordination centers that potentially contribute to the development of situational\nawareness. The UCG assumes responsibility for coordinating federal response activities at the\nincident level once unified coordination is established, freeing the RRCC to deal with new\nincidents should they occur.\n Joint Operations Center (JOC). In response to significant threats within the criminal jurisdiction\nof the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may establish a JOC, which is a\nregional multi-jurisdictional, interagency operations center to lead and coordinate the operational\nlaw enforcement response, including but not limited to investigative operations and related\nintelligence activities. The JOC is led by an FBI on-scene commander (OSC) and is supported by\na command group and a consequence management group, as appropriate. If the threat involves\npotential attacks or threats spanning multiple geographic areas, then multiple JOCs may be\nestablished. The JOC acts as the focal point for the strategic management and direction of on scene\nlaw enforcement activities and coordination with local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\nauthorities. Additionally, the FBI OSC may be supported by the Domestic Emergency Support\nTeam (if deployed), which may provide interagency technical or scientific expertise.\nFederal Headquarters Operational Support\nCoordinating structures are assembled and organized at the federal headquarters level, particularly to\naddress incidents that cross regional borders or have broad geographic or system-wide implications.\nFederal Operations Centers\nMost Cabinet-level and some other federal departments and agencies have headquarters-level\noperations centers. A wide range of such centers maintain situational awareness within their functional\n23\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nareas and provide relevant information to the DHS National Operations Center (NOC)22 during an\nincident. These operations centers may also coordinate ESF activities, communicate with other federal\noperations centers, and communicate with their local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area\ngovernment counterparts. Examples of FOCs include the following:\n National Operations Center. In the event of an act of terrorism, natural disaster, or other\nemergency, the NOC, as the principal operations center for DHS, coordinates and integrates\ninformation from the NOC components to provide situational awareness and a common operating\npicture for the entire Federal Government, as well as for local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular\narea governments, as appropriate, to ensure that accurate and critical terrorism and disaster-related\ninformation reaches government decision makers in a timely manner. Additionally, the NOC serves\nas the national fusion center, collecting and synthesizing all-source information, including\ninformation from state and major urban area fusion centers, for all threats and hazards across the\nentire integrated National Preparedness System.\n National Response Coordination Center. When activated, the NRCC is a multiagency\ncoordination center located at FEMA Headquarters. NRCC’s staff coordinates the overall federal\nsupport for major disasters and emergencies, including catastrophic incidents and emergency\nmanagement program implementation. FEMA maintains the NRCC as a functional component of\nthe NOC for incident support operations.\nThe National Business Emergency Operations Center is a FEMA component within the\nNRCC that acts as mechanism for information sharing between public and private sector\nstakeholders. The NRCC also includes the public affairs function of ESF #15, which acts\nas a mechanism to synchronize external messaging among all impacted and responding\norganizations.\n Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Integrated Operations\nCoordination Center (CIOCC). The CIOCC is composed of the National Cybersecurity and\nCommunications Integration Center, the National Infrastructure Coordinating Center, and the\nNational Coordinating Center for Communications. It is the focal point for federal partners, the\nprivate sector, and local, state, tribal, and territorial governments to obtain situational awareness,\ntechnical assistance, and integrated, actionable information to secure and defend the Nation’s\ncyber, physical, and communications infrastructure. The CIOCC operates around the clock to\nintegrate, coordinate, and share risk and threat information with the critical infrastructure\ncommunity, perform consequence analyses of incidents affecting critical infrastructure, inform\ndecision making, provide technical expertise to address cyber threats and communications outages,\nand coordinate infrastructure-related support for broader federal response efforts.\n National Military Command Center (NMCC). The Department of Defense’s (DoD) NMCC is\nthe Nation’s focal point for continuous monitoring and coordination of worldwide military\noperations. The NMCC directly supports combatant commanders, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs\nof Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the President in the command of U.S. Armed Forces in\npeacetime contingencies and war. The NMCC participates in a wide variety of activities, ranging\nfrom missile warning and attack assessment to management of peacetime operations, such as\n22 The NOC is composed of the NOC Watch, Intelligence Watch, FEMA National Watch Center, National Response\nCoordination Center, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Integrated Operations Coordination\nCenter.\n24\n\n\nNational Response Framework\ndefense support of civil authorities during special events, major disasters, and national\nemergencies.\n Strategic Information and Operations Center (SIOC). The SIOC acts as the FBI’s worldwide\nEOC. The SIOC maintains situational awareness of criminal or terrorist threats and critical\nincidents and crises (foreign and domestic, regardless of cause or origin) and provides FBI\nheadquarters executives, domestic field offices, and overseas legal attachés with timely notification\nand the dissemination of strategic information. The SIOC shares information and intelligence with\nother EOCs at all levels of government. Maintaining a constant state of readiness to support any\ncrisis or major event, the SIOC provides a secure venue to support crisis management, special event\nmonitoring, and significant operations. The SIOC provides command, control, communications\nconnectivity, and a common operating picture for managing FBI operational responses and assets\nthroughout the world on behalf of FBI Headquarters, divisions, field offices, and legal attachés. In\nthe event of a crisis, the SIOC establishes the headquarters command post and develops\nconnectivity to field command posts and JOCs. The FBI-led Weapons of Mass Destruction\nStrategic Group is activated within the SIOC when facing weapons of mass destruction terrorist\nthreats. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Strategic Group is an interagency crisis action team that\nsupports information exchange and the deconfliction of counterterrorism activities.\nThe specific structures activated for a given incident depend on the levels of government involved, as\nwell as the legal authorities under which the response is being conducted.\nNational Security Council\nThe National Security Council (NSC) is the principal policy body for consideration of national security\npolicy issues requiring Presidential determination. The NSC advises and assists the President in\nintegrating all aspects of national security policy as it affects the United States—domestic, foreign,\nmilitary, intelligence, and economic (in conjunction with the National Economic Council).\nRoles and Responsibilities for Response\nThis section describes those roles and responsibilities and sharpens the focus on identifying who is\ninvolved with the response mission area. This section also addresses what the various partners must do\nto deliver the response core capabilities and to integrate successfully with the prevention, protection,\nmitigation, and recovery mission areas.\nAn effective, unified national response requires layered, mutually supporting capabilities. Individuals\nand communities, the private sector, NGOs, and all levels of government (local, state, tribal, territorial,\ninsular area, and federal) should each understand their respective roles and responsibilities and how to\ncomplement each other in achieving shared goals. All elements of the whole community play roles in\ndeveloping the core capabilities needed to respond to incidents. This includes developing plans that\nensure continuity of operations, conducting assessments and exercises, providing and directing\nresources and capabilities, and gathering lessons-learned. These activities require that all partners\nunderstand how they fit within and are supported by the structures described in the NRF.\nEmergency management staff in all jurisdictions and organizations have a fundamental responsibility\nto consider the needs of the whole community. These needs must be incorporated into response\nplanning and delivery of the core capabilities. The potential contributions of all individuals toward\ndelivering core capabilities during incident response (e.g., through associations and alliances that serve\nthe people previously identified) should be incorporated into planning efforts.\n25\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nEmergency management staff must also consider those who own or have responsibility for animals,\nboth as members of the community who may be affected by incidents and as a potential means of\nsupporting response efforts. This includes those with household pets, service and assistance animals,\nworking dogs, and agricultural animals/livestock, as well as those who have responsibility for wildlife,\nexotic animals, zoo animals, research animals, and animals housed in shelters, rescue organizations,\nbreeding facilities, and sanctuaries.\nCommunities\nCommunities are groups that share goals, values, and institutions. Communities are not always limited\nby geographic boundaries or political divisions. Instead, communities may be faith-based\norganizations; voluntary organizations; neighborhood partnerships; advocacy groups; academia;\ncultural, social, and community groups; and associations. Communities bring people together in\ndifferent ways for different reasons, but each community provides opportunities for sharing\ninformation and promoting collective action. These communities may have resources and information\nto stabilize community lifelines. Engaging these groups in preparedness efforts, particularly at the\nlocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area levels, is important to identifying their needs and taking\nadvantage of their potential contributions.\nPrivate Sector\nPrivate sector organizations engage in incident response through their own internal response and\ncontinuity actions, the commodities they provide, their partnerships with each level of government,\nand their roles within the supply chain. Elements of the private sector are most often the providers of\ncommunity lifeline services and have a key interest in the stabilization and restoration of their own\noperations and those of other infrastructure systems. Private sector organizations also play a vital role\nin ensuring communities and survivors have the services and resources necessary to respond to and\nrecover from all types of incidents. The private sector, comprised of small, medium, and large\nbusinesses, spans nationally significant infrastructure to locally owned and operated businesses that,\nwhile small, are staples of the community. The private sector includes commerce; healthcare; private,\ncultural, and educational institutions; and industry, as well as public/private partnerships that have been\nestablished specifically for emergency management purposes. During an incident, key private sector\npartners should have a direct link to emergency managers and other relevant officials, such as those\nfrom public health, economic development, and community planning agencies and, in some cases, be\ninvolved in the decision-making process. Strong integration into response efforts can offer many\nbenefits to the public and private sectors.\nAs key elements of the national economy, it is important for private sector organizations of all types\nand sizes to engage in preparedness planning, conduct risk assessments, and identify critical\ncommunity lifelines, functions, and resources that impact their businesses and communities.\nUnderstanding and collaborating on the cross-sector interdependencies and cascading effects of a\npotentially high-consequence incident on business, infrastructure, and supply chains improves\ncommunity resilience and can help private sector organizations to quickly resume normal operations.\nUltimately, the ability of the private sector to recover is inextricably linked to community recovery.\nOwners and operators of certain regulated facilities or hazardous operations may be legally responsible\nfor preparing for and preventing incidents and responding when an incident occurs. For example, the\nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, and associated regulations require owners and operators of\ncommercial nuclear powerplants and offsite response organizations (OROs) to maintain emergency\nplans in order protect the health and safety of the public. Onsite response organizations and OROs\nperform exercises, assessments, notifications, and training for incident response. Because of their\n26\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nsignificance in providing essential functions and services, it is vital that private critical infrastructure\nsectors, such as privately-owned transportation and transit, telecommunications, utilities, financial\ninstitutions, hospitals, and other health-related facilities, create and sustain effective business\ncontinuity plans.\nPrivate sector entities may serve as partners in local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area emergency\npreparedness and response organizations and activities and with federal sector-specific agencies.\nPrivate sector entities often participate in local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area preparedness\nactivities by providing resources (donated or compensated) during an incident—including specialized\nteams, essential services, equipment, and advanced technologies—through local public-private\nemergency plans or mutual aid and assistance agreements or in response to requests from government\nand nongovernmental initiatives.\nRestoring economic activity in an impacted area is fundamental to the recovery of the community.\nExamples of key private sector activities that support this effort include the following:\n Planning, training, and exercising their response capabilities;\n Planning for, responding to, and recovering from incidents that impact their own infrastructure and\nfacilities;\n Protecting information, and maintaining the continuity of business operations in order to ensure\nthe integrity of supply chains or quickly establishing new supply chains to stabilize the community\nand reduce human suffering;\n Providing assistance specified under mutual aid and assistance agreements;\n Addressing the welfare of employees (including disbursement of wages);\n Executing their own immediate response activities and meeting the continuity needs of\ninfrastructure, facilities, and business operations;\n Collaborating with emergency management personnel to determine what assistance may be\nrequired and how they can provide needed support;\n Contributing to communication and information-sharing efforts during incidents, and providing\ninsight on the scope and scale of impacts;\n Identifying requirements for public sector support to enable stabilization of critical community\nlifelines; and\n Contributing resources, personnel, and expertise; helping to shape objectives; and receiving\ninformation about the status of the community.\nIndividuals, Families, and Households\nIndividuals, families, and households reduce potential emergency response requirements and hazards\nin and around their homes by efforts such as raising utilities above flood level or securing unanchored\nobjects against the threat of high winds. Individuals, families, and households should also prepare\nemergency supply kits and emergency plans, so they can take care of themselves and their neighbors\nuntil assistance arrives. Information on emergency preparedness can be found at many local, state,\ntribal, territorial, insular area, voluntary organization, and federal emergency management Websites,\nsuch as http://www.ready.gov.\nIndividuals can also contribute to the preparedness and resilience of their households and communities\nby volunteering with emergency organizations (e.g., the local chapter of the American Red Cross,\n27\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nMedical Reserve Corps, Community Emergency Response Teams, or National Voluntary\nOrganizations Active in Disaster [National VOAD]) and completing emergency response training\ncourses. Individuals who have access and functional or medical needs should make preparations with\nfamily members. Their plans should include provisions for personal assistance service providers and\nany household pets or service and assistance animals. During an actual disaster, emergency, or threat,\nindividuals, households, and families should monitor emergency communications and follow guidance\nand instructions provided by local authorities.\nNongovernmental Organizations\nNGOs are a distinct category of organizations within the private sector that can support disaster\nresponse and recovery. NGOs include voluntary, ethnic, faith-based, veteran-based, disability, and\nnonprofit organizations that provide sheltering, emergency food supplies, and other essential support\nservices for people, household pets, and service animals. NGOs are inherently independent and\ncommitted to specific interests and values. These interests and values drive the groups’ operational\npriorities and shape the resources they provide. NGOs bolster government efforts at all levels and often\nprovide specialized services to the whole community. NGOs are key partners in preparedness activities\nand response operations.\nExamples of NGO contributions include the following:\n Training, management, and coordination of volunteers and donated goods;\n Ensuring staff are screened, trained, and able to safely perform their tasks;\n Identifying sheltering locations, ensuring access to those facilities, and communicating their\nlocations to the whole community;\n Providing emergency commodities and services, such as water, food, shelter, assistance with\nfamily reunification, clothing, and supplies for post-emergency cleanup;\n Supporting the evacuation, rescue, care, and sheltering of animals displaced by the incident;\n Supporting search and rescue, transportation, and logistics services and support;\n Identifying and supporting the unmet needs of survivors who have been affected by the disaster;\n Identifying and supporting the heath, medical, mental health, and behavior health resources of the\nimpacted community; and\n Supporting disaster survivors, identifying unmet needs, and developing individual recovery plans.\nAt the same time, when NGOs support response core capabilities they may also require government\nassistance. When planning for local community emergency management resources, government\norganizations should consider the potential need to support NGOs in performing their essential\nresponse functions. Volunteers and donors support response efforts in many ways. Governments at all\nlevels must plan ahead to incorporate volunteers and donated resources into response activities. Close\ncollaboration with the voluntary organizations and agencies assists in managing the influx of\nvolunteers and donations. Additional information can be found in the Volunteers and Donations\nManagement Support Annex.\nSome NGOs and functions are officially designated as support elements to national response\ncapabilities, such as the following:\n The American Red Cross. The American Red Cross is chartered by Congress to provide relief to\nsurvivors of disasters and help people prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from\n28\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nemergencies. The Red Cross has a legal status of a “federal chartered instrumentality” and\nmaintains a special relationship with the Federal Government.23 In this capacity, the American Red\nCross is the co-lead of ESF #6 and supports several other ESFs and the delivery of multiple core\ncapabilities.\n National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.24 National VOAD is an association of\norganizations that mitigates and alleviates the impact of disasters; provides a forum promoting\ncooperation, communication, coordination and collaboration; and fosters more effective delivery\nof services to communities impacted by a disaster. National VOAD is a consortium of over\n70 national organizations and 56 territorial and state equivalents.\n National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). Within the NCMEC, the\nNational Emergency Child Locator Center facilitates the expeditious identification and\nreunification of children with their families.\nLocal Government\nThe responsibility for responding to natural and human-caused incidents that have recognizable\ngeographic boundaries generally begins at the local level with individuals and public officials in the\ncounty, parish, city, or town affected by an incident. The following paragraphs describe the\nresponsibilities of specific local officials who have emergency management responsibilities.\nChief Elected or Appointed Official\nJurisdictional chief executives are responsible for the public safety and welfare of the people of their\njurisdiction. Officials provide strategic guidance and resources across all five mission areas. Chief\nelected or appointed officials must have a clear understanding of their emergency management roles\nand responsibilities and how to apply the response core capabilities because they may need to make\ndecisions regarding resources and operations during an incident to stabilize community lifelines. Lives\nmay depend on their decisions. Elected and appointed officials also routinely shape or modify laws,\npolicies, and budgets to aid preparedness efforts and improve emergency management and response\ncapabilities. The local chief executive’s response duties may include the following:\n Obtaining assistance from other governmental agencies,\n Providing direction for response activities, and\n Ensuring appropriate information is provided to the public.\nLocal Emergency Manager\nThe jurisdiction’s emergency manager oversees the day-to-day emergency management programs and\nactivities. The emergency manager works with chief elected and appointed officials to establish unified\nobjectives regarding the jurisdiction’s emergency plans and activities. This role entails coordinating\nand integrating all elements of the community. The emergency manager coordinates the local\nemergency management program. This includes assessing the capacity and readiness to deliver the\ncapabilities most likely required to stabilize community lifelines during an incident and identifying\nand correcting shortfalls. The local emergency manager’s duties often include the following:\n Advising elected and appointed officials during a response;\n23 36 U.S.C. Chapter 3001: The American Red Cross.\n24 Additional information is available at https://www.nvoad.org/.\n29\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Conducting response operations in accordance with the NIMS.\n Coordinating the functions of local agencies;\n Coordinating the development of plans, and working cooperatively with other local agencies,\ncommunity organizations, private sector businesses, and NGOs;\n Developing and maintaining mutual aid and assistance agreements;\n Coordinating resource requests during an incident through the management of an emergency\noperations center;\n Coordinating damage assessments during an incident;\n Advising and informing local officials and the public about emergency management activities\nduring an incident to facilitate response operations such as sheltering, avoiding, evacuating, and\nresupply of food and water;\n Developing and executing accessible public awareness and education programs;\n Conducting exercises to rehearse response activities; test personnel, plans and systems; and\nidentify areas for improvement;\n Coordinating integration of individuals with disabilities, individuals from racially and ethnically\ndiverse backgrounds, and others with access and functional needs into emergency planning and\nresponse; and\n Helping to ensure the continuation of essential services and functions through the development and\nimplementation of continuity of operations plans.\nOther Local Departments and Agencies\nLocal government department and agency heads collaborate with the emergency manager during the\ndevelopment of local emergency plans and provide key response resources. Participation in the\nplanning process helps to ensure that specific capabilities are integrated into a workable plan to\nsafeguard the community. The department and agency heads and their staffs develop, plan, and train\non internal policies and procedures to meet response needs safely, and they participate in interagency\ntraining and exercises to develop and maintain necessary capabilities.\nSimilar to the federal and state level, local emergency management agencies are not the\nonly entities involved in incident response. Local departments, agencies, and offices, such\nas those for emergency medical services, economic development, public health, law\nenforcement, fire, public works, land use planning, building construction, and animal\ncontrol, as well as other administrative elements of local government, have a significant\nrole to play and provide valuable perspective, depending on the incident.\nState, Tribal, Territorial, and Insular Area Government\nState, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments are responsible for the health and welfare of their\nresidents, communities, lands, and cultural heritage.\nStates\nState governments supplement local efforts before, during, and after incidents by applying in-state\nresources first. When an incident expands or has the potential to expand beyond the capability of a\n30\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nlocal jurisdiction and responders cannot meet the needs with mutual aid and assistance resources, local\nofficials contact the state.\nUpon receiving a request for assistance from a local or tribal government, state officials may do the\nfollowing:\n Coordinate warnings and public information through the activation of the state’s public\ncommunications strategy;\n Distribute supplies stockpiled to meet the needs of the emergency;\n Provide technical assistance and support to meet the response and recovery needs;\n Suspend or waive statutes, rules, ordinances, and orders, to the extent permitted by law, to ensure\ntimely performance of response functions;\n Implement state volunteer and donations management plans, and coordinate with the private sector\nand voluntary organizations;\n Order or recommend evacuations ensuring the integration and inclusion of the requirements of\npopulations such as children; individuals with disabilities and others with access and functional\nneeds; those from religious, racial, and ethnically diverse communities; people with limited English\nproficiency; and owners of animals, including household pets and service and assistance animals;\nand\n Mobilize resources to meet the requirements of individuals with disabilities and others with access\nand functional needs in compliance with federal civil rights laws.\nIf additional resources are required, states can request assistance from other states through interstate\nmutual aid and assistance agreements such as the Emergency Management Assistance Compact\n(EMAC). Administered by the National Emergency Management Association, EMAC is an interstate\nmutual aid agreement that streamlines the interstate mutual aid and assistance process. If a state\nanticipates that its resources may be exceeded, the governor25 may request assistance from the Federal\nGovernment through a Stafford Act declaration.\nThe following paragraphs describe some of the roles and responsibilities of key officials, as well as\nother departments and agencies.\nGovernor\nThe public safety and welfare of a state’s residents are the fundamental responsibilities of every\ngovernor. The governor coordinates state resources and provides the strategic guidance for response to\nall types of incidents. This includes supporting local governments, as needed, and coordinating\nassistance with other states and the Federal Government. A governor also does the following during\nresponse:\n In accordance with state law, may make, amend, or suspend certain orders or regulations associated\nwith response efforts;\n Communicates to the public in an accessible manner (i.e., effective communications to address all\nmembers of the whole community), and helps people, businesses, and organizations cope with the\nconsequences of and protective actions for any type of incident;\n Coordinates with tribal governments within the state; and\n25 “Governor” is used throughout this document to refer to the chief executive of states, territories, and insular areas.\n31\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Commands the state military forces (National Guard personnel not in federal service and state\ndefense forces).\nState Homeland Security Adviser\nMany states have designated homeland security advisers who serve as counsel to the governor on\nhomeland security issues and may serve as a liaison between the governor’s office, the state homeland\nsecurity structure, and other organizations inside and outside of the state. The advisor may chair a\ncommittee composed of representatives of relevant state agencies, including public safety, the National\nGuard, emergency management, public health, environment, agriculture, and others charged with\ndeveloping prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery strategies.\nState Emergency Management Agency Director\nAll states have laws mandating the establishment of a state emergency management agency, as well as\nthe emergency plans coordinated by that agency. The director of the state emergency management\nagency is responsible for ensuring that the state is prepared to deal with large-scale emergencies and\ncoordinating the statewide response to such incidents. This includes supporting local and tribal\ngovernments, as needed; coordinating assistance with other states and the Federal Government; and,\nin some cases, with NGOs and private sector organizations. The state emergency management agency\nmay dispatch personnel to assist in the response and recovery effort.\nNational Guard\nThe National Guard is an important state resource available for planning, preparing, and responding to\nnatural or human-caused incidents.26 National Guard members have expertise in critical areas, such as\nemergency medical response; communications; logistics; search and rescue; civil engineering;\nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response and planning; and decontamination.\nThe governor may order members of the National Guard to state active-duty status to support state\nfunctions and activities. The governor or the state adjutant general may assign members of the National\nGuard to assist with state, regional, and federal emergency management plans. In American Samoa,\nthe governor coordinates response activities with the U.S. Army Reserve because it is the sole U.S.\nterritory with no National Guard.\nOther State Departments and Agencies\nState department and agency heads and their staffs develop, plan, and train on internal policies and\nprocedures to meet response and recovery needs. As discussed earlier, these departments and agencies\nrepresent the full range of authorities and resources of the state government, such as law enforcement,\ntransportation, housing, economic development, public works, health, social services, and agriculture.\nState department and agency heads also provide important links to regional voluntary organizations,\nbusiness, and industry. Staff from these departments and agencies also participate in interagency\ntraining and exercises to develop and maintain the necessary capabilities and share resources through\nmutual aid agreements. State department and agency heads are vital to the state’s overall emergency\nmanagement program because they bring expertise spanning various response functions and serve as\ncore members of the state EOC and ICP. Many state department and agency heads have direct\n26 The President may order National Guard forces to active duty (e.g., sections 12302 or 12304 of title 10, U.S.C.),\ncall National Guard forces into Federal service (e.g., the Insurrection Act), or request National Guard force support of\nDoD operations or missions (e.g., section 502(f) of title 32 U.S.C.) in the United States. When ordered to active duty\nor called into Federal service, National Guard forces operate under the command of the Secretary of Defense.\n32\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nexperience in providing accessible and vital services to the whole community during response\noperations. State departments and agencies typically work in close coordination with their federal\ncounterpart agencies during joint state and federal responses, and under some federal laws, they may\nrequest assistance from these federal partners.\nTribes\nIn accordance with the Stafford Act, the chief executive27 of an affected Indian tribal government may\nsubmit a request for a declaration by the President. Tribal governments are responsible for coordinating\nresources to address actual or potential incidents. When coordinating with tribes, language and cultural\ndifferences must be considered, as well as overlapping authorities.\nTribes are encouraged to build relationships with local jurisdictions and states because these entities\nmay have resources most readily available. The NRF’s Tribal Coordination Support Annex outlines\nprocesses and mechanisms that tribal governments may use to request federal assistance during an\nincident.\nChief Executive\nThe chief executive is responsible for the public safety and welfare of his/her respective tribe. The\nchief executive coordinates tribal resources and helps guide the response to all types of incidents. This\nincludes coordinating assistance with states, as well as the Federal Government. The chief executive\ndoes the following during response:\n In accordance with the law, may make, amend, or suspend certain orders or regulations associated\nwith the response;\n Communicates with the public in an accessible manner, and helps people, businesses, and\norganizations cope with the consequences of all types of incidents;\n Negotiates mutual aid and assistance agreements with other local jurisdictions, states, tribes,\nterritories, and insular area governments; and\n Can request federal assistance.\nTerritorial and Insular Area Governments\nTerritorial and insular area governments are responsible for coordinating resources to address actual\nor potential incidents and have many of the same functions states have, as previously listed in this\nsection. Because of their remote locations, territorial and insular area governments often face unique\nchallenges in receiving assistance from outside the jurisdiction quickly and often request assistance\nfrom neighboring islands, other nearby countries, states, the private sector or NGO resources, or the\nFederal Government. Additionally, there are language and cultural differences that must be considered,\nas well as the potential for authorities that overlap with federal authorities.\nTerritorial/Insular Area Leader\nThe territorial/insular area leader is responsible for the public safety and welfare of the people of his/her\njurisdiction. As authorized by the territorial or insular area government, the leader does the following:\n Coordinates resources needed to respond to incidents of all types;\n27 The Stafford Act uses the term “chief executive” to refer to the person who is the chief, chairman, governor,\npresident, or similar executive official of an Indian tribal government.\n33\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n In accordance with the law, may make, amend, or suspend certain orders or regulations associated\nwith the response;\n Communicates with the public in an accessible manner, and helps people, businesses, and\norganizations cope with the consequences of all types of incidents;\n Commands the territory’s military forces;\n Negotiates mutual aid and assistance agreements with other local jurisdictions, states, tribes,\nterritories, and insular area governments; and\n Can request federal assistance.\nFederal Government\nThe Federal Government maintains a wide range of capabilities and resources that may be required to\ndeal with domestic incidents in order to save lives and protect property and the environment while\nensuring the protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties and supporting the stabilization of\ncommunity lifelines. To be successful, any approach to the delivery of response capabilities will\nrequire an all-of-nation approach. All federal departments and agencies must cooperate with one\nanother and with local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments, community members,\nvoluntary organizations, and the private sector to the maximum extent possible.\nThe Federal Government becomes involved with a response when federal interests are involved; when\nlocal, state, tribal, territorial, or insular resources are insufficient and federal assistance is requested;\nor as authorized or required by statute, regulation, or policy. Accordingly, in some instances, the\nFederal Government may play a supporting role to local, state, tribal, territorial, or insular area\nauthorities by providing federal assistance to the affected parties. For example, the Federal\nGovernment provides assistance to local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area authorities when the\nPresident declares a major disaster or emergency under the Stafford Act. In other instances, the Federal\nGovernment may play a leading role in the response where the Federal Government has primary\njurisdiction or when incidents occur on federal property (e.g., national parks and military bases).\nRegardless of the type of incident, the President leads the Federal Government response effort to ensure\nthat the necessary resources are applied quickly and efficiently to large-scale and catastrophic\nincidents. Different federal departments or agencies lead coordination of the Federal Government’s\nresponse, depending on the type and magnitude of the incident, and are also supported by other\nagencies that bring their relevant capabilities to bear in responding to the incident.\nSecretary of Homeland Security\nIn conjunction with these efforts, the statutory mission of DHS is to act as a focal point regarding\nnatural and human-caused crises and emergency planning. Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act and\nPresidential directive, the Secretary of Homeland Security is the principal federal official for domestic\nincident management. The Secretary of Homeland Security coordinates preparedness activities within\nthe United States to respond to and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other\nemergencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security coordinates with federal entities to provide for\nfederal unity of efforts for domestic incident management. As part of these responsibilities, the\nSecretary of Homeland Security does the following during response:\n Provides the executive branch with an overall architecture for domestic incident management, and\ncoordinates the federal response, as required; and\n34\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Monitors activities, assesses risk, and activates specific response mechanisms to support other\nfederal departments and agencies without assuming the overall coordination of the federal response\nduring incidents that do not require the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate the response\nor do not result in a Stafford Act declaration.\nOther federal departments and agencies carry out their response authorities and responsibilities within\nthis overarching construct of DHS coordination.\nUnity of effort differs from unity of command. Various federal departments and agencies may have\nstatutory responsibilities and lead roles based on the unique circumstances of the incident. Unity of\neffort provides coordination through cooperation and common interests and does not interfere with\nfederal departments’ and agencies’ supervisory, command, or statutory authorities. The Secretary of\nHomeland Security does the following during response:\n Ensures that overall federal actions are unified, complete, and synchronized to prevent unfilled\ngaps in the Federal Government’s overarching effort. This coordinated approach ensures that the\nfederal actions undertaken by DHS and other departments and agencies are harmonized and\nmutually supportive.\n Executes these coordination responsibilities, in part, by engaging directly with the President and\nrelevant Cabinet, department, agency, and DHS component heads, as is necessary, to ensure a\nfocused, efficient, and unified federal preparedness posture. All federal departments and agencies,\nin turn, cooperate with the Secretary of Homeland Security in executing domestic incident\nmanagement duties.\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security’s responsibilities also include management of the broad\nemergency management and response authorities of FEMA and other DHS components. DHS\ncomponent heads may have lead response roles or other significant roles, depending on the type and\nseverity of the incident. For example, the U.S. Secret Service is the lead agency for security design,\nplanning, and implementation of national special security events, while the Assistant Director for\nCybersecurity for DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) coordinates the\nresponse to significant cyber incidents.\nFEMA Administrator\nThe FEMA Administrator is the principal adviser to the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security,\nand the National Security Council regarding emergency management. The FEMA Administrator’s\nduties include the following:\n Assisting the President, through the Secretary of Homeland Security, in carrying out the Stafford\nAct, operation of the NRCC and RRCCs, the effective support of all ESFs, and, more generally,\npreparation for, protection against, response to, and recovery from all types of incidents.\n Reporting to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the FEMA Administrator is also responsible for\nmanaging the core DHS grant programs supporting homeland security activities.28\nAttorney General\nThe Attorney General has lead responsibility for criminal investigations of terrorist acts or terrorist\nthreats by individuals or groups inside the United States or directed at U.S. citizens or institutions\nabroad, where such acts are within the federal criminal jurisdiction of the United States. The Attorney\n28 See the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, enacted as part of the Fiscal Year 2007 DHS\nAppropriations Act, Public Law 109-295.\n35\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nGeneral is also responsible for related intelligence collection activities within the United States, subject\nto the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended) and other applicable laws, Executive Order 12333\n(as amended), and Attorney General-approved procedures pursuant to that Executive order.\n Acting through the FBI, the Attorney General, in cooperation with other federal departments and\nagencies engaged in activities to protect the national security, shall also coordinate the activities of\nthe other members of the law enforcement community to detect, prevent, preempt, and disrupt\nterrorist attacks against the United States.\n In addition, the Attorney General, generally acting through the FBI Director, has primary\nresponsibility for searching for, finding, and neutralizing weapons of mass destruction within the\nUnited States.\n The Attorney General approves requests submitted by state governors, pursuant to the Emergency\nFederal Law Enforcement Assistance Act, for personnel and other federal law enforcement support\nduring incidents.\n The Attorney General also enforces federal civil rights laws, such as the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Further\ninformation on the Attorney General’s role is provided in the National Prevention Framework and\nPrevention FIOP.\nSecretary of Defense\nThe Secretary of Defense has authority, direction, and control over DoD.29 DoD resources may be\ncommitted when requested by another federal agency and approved by the Secretary of Defense or\nwhen directed by the President. Certain DoD officials and DoD component heads, by statute and/or\nDoD policy, are authorized to approve or delegate the authority to approve certain types of support to\ncivil authorities.30 DoD policy regarding defense support of civil authorities can be found in DoD\nDirective 3025.18, Defense Support to Civil Authorities.31 32 When DoD resources are authorized to\nsupport civil authorities, command of those forces remains with the Secretary of Defense. Under the\ncommand and control of the Secretary of Defense, the operational coordination and employment of\nsuch resources are normally led by the designated Combatant Command (e.g., U.S. Northern\nCommand, Southern Command, or Indo-Pacific Command). DoD elements in the incident area of\noperations coordinate closely with response organizations at all levels.\n29 10 U.S.C. §113.\n30 For example, certain DoD officials may provide an immediate response by temporarily employing the resources\nunder their control, subject to any supplemental direction provided by higher headquarters, to save lives, prevent\nhuman suffering, or mitigate great property damage within the United States in response to a request for assistance\nfrom a civil authority, under imminently serious conditions and, if time does not permit, obtaining approval from a\nhigher authority. Immediate response authority does not permit actions that would subject civilians to the use of\nmilitary power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory (DoD Directive 3025.18). DoD support\nmay also include support provided through mutual or automatic aid agreements, pursuant to Chapter 15A of Title 42\nU.S.C. or pursuant to other statutory authorities or agreements.\n31 For example, DoD Instruction 3025.24, “DoD Public Health and Medical Services in Support of Civil Authorities.”\n32For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has independent statutory authorities regarding emergency\nmanagement, such as Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1941 (Public Law 84-99) (e.g., providing technical\nassistance; direct assistance, such as providing sandbags, pumps, and other types of flood fight materials; emergency\ncontracting; and emergency water assistance due to contaminated water source). Also, the Defense Logistics Agency\nhas an interagency agreement with FEMA to provide commodities, including fuel, to civil authorities responding to\ndisasters.\n36\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nSecretary of State\nA domestic incident may have international and diplomatic implications that call for coordination and\nconsultation with foreign governments and international organizations. The Secretary of State is\nresponsible for all communication and coordination between the U.S. Government and other nations\nregarding the response to a domestic crisis. The Department of State also coordinates international\noffers of assistance and formally accepts or declines these offers on behalf of the U.S. Government,\nbased on needs conveyed by federal departments and agencies, as stated in the International\nCoordination Support Annex. Some types of international assistance are pre-identified, and bilateral\nagreements are already established. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Forest\nService and Department of the Interior have joint bilateral agreements with several countries for\nwildland firefighting support.\nDirector of National Intelligence\nThe Director of National Intelligence serves as the head of the intelligence community, acts as the\nprincipal advisor to the President for intelligence matters relating to national security, and oversees\nand directs implementation of the National Intelligence Program. The intelligence community,\ncomprising 17 elements across the Federal Government, functions consistent with laws, Executive\norders, regulations, and policies to support the national security-related missions of the U.S.\nGovernment. The Director of National Intelligence provides a range of analytic products, including\nthose that assess threats to the homeland and inform planning, capability development, and operational\nactivities of homeland security enterprise partners and stakeholders. In addition to intelligence\ncommunity elements with specific homeland security missions, the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence maintains a number of mission and support centers that provide unique capabilities for\nhomeland security partners.\nEmergency Support Function Roles and Responsibilities\nESFs are not solely attributed to any one organization, nor are they mechanisms for executing an\nagency’s statutory authorities. The federal ESFs bring together the capabilities of federal departments\nand agencies and other national-level assets. Most federal ESFs support a number of the response core\ncapabilities. The core capabilities are delivered to stabilize the community lifelines. Any core\ncapability may be required to help stabilize any community lifeline; therefore, any ESF can contribute\ntoward the stabilization of any community lifeline in coordination with the lead ESF.\nFederal ESFs are groups of organizations that work together to deliver core capabilities to stabilize\ncommunity lifelines in support of an effective response. In addition, there are responsibilities and\nactions associated with federal ESFs that extend beyond the core capabilities and support other\nresponse activities, as well as department and agency responsibilities. While ESFs are primarily a\nfederal coordinating mechanism, states and other organizations or levels of government may adopt the\nconstruct, as well.\nFederal ESF coordinators oversee the preparedness activities for a particular ESF and coordinate\nwith its primary and support agencies. Responsibilities of the ESF coordinator include the following\nduring response:\n Maintaining contact with ESF primary and support agencies through conference calls, meetings,\ntraining activities, and exercises;\n Monitoring the ESF’s progress in delivering the core capabilities in an effort to stabilize the incident;\n Coordinating efforts with corresponding private sector, NGO, and federal partners;\n37\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Ensuring the ESF is engaged in appropriate planning and preparedness activities; and\n Sharing information and coordinating across the spectrum of primary and support agencies.\nESF primary agencies have significant authorities, roles, resources, and capabilities for a particular\nfunction within an ESF. Primary agencies are responsible for the following:\n Orchestrating support and strategy development within their functional area for the appropriate\nresponse core capabilities and other ESF missions;\n Notifying and requesting assistance from support agencies;\n Managing mission assignments (in Stafford Act incidents), and coordinating with support agencies,\nas well as appropriate state officials, operations centers, and other stakeholders;\n Coordinating resources resulting from mission assignments;\n Working with all types of organizations to maximize the use of all available resources;\n Monitoring progress in delivering core capability and other ESF missions, and providing that\ninformation as part of situational and periodic readiness or preparedness assessments;\n Planning for incident management, short-term recovery operations, and transition to long-term\nrecovery support operations;\n Maintaining trained personnel to support interagency emergency response and support teams;\n Identifying new equipment or capabilities required to prevent or respond to new or emerging\nthreats and hazards or to validate and improve capabilities to address changing risks; and\n Promoting physical accessibility, programmatic inclusion, and effective communication for the\nwhole community, including individuals with disabilities.\nESF support agencies have specific capabilities or resources that support primary agencies in\nexecuting the mission of the ESF. The activities of support agencies typically include the following:\n Participating in planning for incident management, short-term recovery operations, transition to\nlong-term recovery support operations, and the development of supporting operational plans,\nstandard operating procedures, checklists, or other job aids;\n Providing input to periodic readiness assessments;\n Maintaining trained personnel to support interagency emergency response and support teams;\n Identifying new equipment or capabilities required to respond to new or emerging threats and\nhazards or to improve the ability to address existing threats; and\n Coordinating resources resulting from response mission assignments.\nTable 4 summarizes the federal ESFs and indicates the response core capabilities each ESF most\ndirectly supports. All ESFs support the common core capabilities—planning, public information and\nwarning, and operational coordination—and many ESFs support more than those listed.\n38\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nTable 4: Emergency Support Functions and ESF Coordinators\nESF #1 – Transportation\nESF Coordinator: Department of Transportation\nCoordinates the support of management of transportation systems and infrastructure, the regulation of\ntransportation, management of the Nation’s airspace, and ensuring the safety and security of the\nnational transportation system.

Focuses particularly on those sectors not currently aligned to other ESFs (e.g., the Financial\nServices Sector). Functions include but are not limited to the following:\n Assessment, analysis, and situational awareness of cross-sector challenges; and\n Facilitates operational coordination with critical infrastructure sectors.\nESF #15 – External Affairs\nESF Coordinator: DHS\nCoordinates the release of accurate, coordinated, timely, and accessible public information to affected\naudiences, including the government, media, NGOs, and the private sector. Works closely with state and\nlocal officials to ensure outreach to the whole community. Functions include but are not limited to the\nfollowing:\n Public affairs and the Joint Information Center;\n Intergovernmental (local, state, tribal, territorial, nongovernmental, and private sector) affairs; and\n Congressional affairs.\n41\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nThe Emergency Support Function Leadership Group (ESFLG) is composed of federal\ndepartments and agencies designated as coordinators for ESFs or coordinating agencies for other\nNRF annexes. The ESFLG provides a forum for departments and agencies with roles in federal\nincident response to jointly address matters pertaining to the community lifelines, emergency\nresponse policy, preparedness, operations, and training. The ESFLG promotes federal unity of effort\nthrough the exchange of information and coordinated decision making during disaster response.\nFEMA leads the ESFLG and is responsible for coordinating steady-state and operational activities.\nOther Federal Department and Agency Heads\nThe heads of all federal departments and agencies provide their full and prompt cooperation, resources,\nand support, as appropriate and consistent with their own responsibilities, for protecting the national\nsecurity. Various federal departments or agencies play primary, coordinating, or support roles in\ndelivering response core capabilities. In some circumstances, other federal agencies may have a lead\nor support role in coordinating operations or elements of operations, consistent with applicable legal\nauthorities. Nothing in the NRF precludes a federal department or agency from executing its existing\nauthorities. For all incidents, federal department and agency heads serve as advisors for the executive\nbranch relative to their areas of responsibility.\nFederal departments and agencies designated as coordinating and cooperating agencies in NRF support\nannexes conduct a variety of activities, to include managing specific functions and missions and\nproviding federal support within their functional areas.\nFederal Authorities\nFederal assistance can be provided to local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area jurisdictions, as\nwell as to other federal departments and agencies, through several different mechanisms and\nauthorities. Federal financial assistance may also be available for disability-related access and\nfunctional needs equipment.\n42\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nDifferent federal departments or agencies lead coordination of the Federal Government’s response\nactions, depending on their express and implied statutory authorities and based on the type and\nmagnitude of the incident. Federal departments or agencies are supported by other agencies who bring\nrelevant capabilities that support those affected by the incident. Figure 5 shows the authorities for\ncoordination of federal response support described in the following sections.\nFigure 5: Incident Management and Response Authorities for the Federal Government\nFederal Response and Assistance Under the Robert T. Stafford\nDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act\nThe Federal Government may provide assistance in the form of funding, resources, and services.\nFederal departments and agencies respect the sovereignty and responsibilities of local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, and insular area governments, while rendering assistance that supports the affected local,\nstate, tribal, territorial, and insular governments.\n43\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nLocal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments do not require federal assistance to respond\nto most incidents; however, when an incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response\nis beyond the capabilities of the local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area governments, the\ngovernor or chief executive of a tribe can request federal assistance under the Stafford Act. In certain\ncircumstances, the President may declare an emergency without a request from a governor when the\nprimary responsibility for response rests with the United States because the emergency involves a\nsubject area for which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the United States exercises\nexclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority.\nThe Stafford Act authorizes the President to provide financial and other assistance to local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, and insular area governments; certain private nonprofit organizations; and individuals to\nsupport response, recovery, and mitigation efforts following a Stafford Act emergency or major\ndisaster declaration.33 Most forms of Stafford Act assistance require a cost share. While federal\nassistance under the Stafford Act may only be delivered after a declaration, FEMA may pre-deploy\nfederal assets when a declaration is likely and imminent. The Stafford Act provides for two types of\ndeclarations:\n An emergency declaration is more limited in scope than a major disaster declaration, involves\nfewer federal programs, and is not normally associated with recovery programs. However, the\nPresident may issue an emergency declaration prior to an actual incident to lessen or avert the\nthreat of a catastrophe. Generally, federal assistance and funding are provided to meet specific\nemergency needs or to help prevent a catastrophe from occurring.\n A major disaster declaration provides more federal programs for response and recovery than an\nemergency declaration. Unlike an emergency declaration, a major disaster declaration may only be\nissued after an incident.\nFederal Departments and Agencies Acting Under Their Own\nAuthorities\nImmediate life-saving assistance to states, tribes, territories, and insular areas, as well as other types of\nassistance, such as wildland firefighting support or response to an agricultural disease or significant\ncyber incident, are performed by federal departments or agencies under their own authorities and\nfunding or through reciprocal mutual assistance agreements. Some federal departments or agencies\nhave authorities to declare specific types of disasters or emergencies and conduct or lead federal\nresponse actions using funding sources other than the Disaster Relief Fund. For example, specific trust\nfunds are established under federal environmental laws to support and fund oil and hazardous\nsubstances response operations. Similarly, federal land management agencies are required at all times\nto respond to incidents of all magnitudes that occur on or impact federal lands managed by those\nagencies, while federal departments and agencies acting under the trust doctrine can provide financial\nand programmatic support to tribes, when requested.\nWhen the Secretary of Homeland Security is not coordinating the overall response, federal departments\nand agencies may coordinate federal operations under their own statutory authorities or as designated\nby the President and may activate response structures applicable to those authorities. The head of the\ndepartment or agency may also request the Secretary of Homeland Security to activate NRF structures\nand elements (e.g. Incident Management Assistance Teams and National Operation Center elements)\nto provide additional assistance, while still retaining leadership for the response.\n33 These authorities may be exercised independently of, concurrently with, or become part of a federal response\ncoordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to Presidential directive.\n44\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFederal departments and agencies carry out their response authorities and responsibilities within the\nNRF’s overarching construct or under supplementary or complementary operational plans. Table 5\nprovides examples of scenarios in which specific federal departments and agencies have the\nresponsibility for coordinating response activities. This is not an all-inclusive list; incident annexes\ncontained in FIOPs provide greater operational detail for these and other incidents.\nTable 5: Examples of Other Federal Department and Agency Authorities34\nScenario Department/Agency Authorities\nThe Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to declare an\nextraordinary emergency and take action because of the\npresence of a pest or disease of livestock that threatens\nAgricultural livestock in the United States. (7 U.S.C. § 8306 [2007]). The\nand Food USDA Secretary of Agriculture also has the authority to declare an\nIncident extraordinary emergency and take action because of the\npresence of a plant pest or noxious weed whose presence\nthreatens plants or plant products of the United States.\n(7 U.S.C. § 7715 [2007]).\nThe Secretary of the Department of Health and Human\nServices has the authority to take actions to protect the public\nhealth and welfare, declare a public health emergency, and\nto prepare for and respond to public health emergencies\n(Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq.).\nThe Public Health Service Act (PHSA), as amended by the\nPublic Health Department of Health Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act,\nand Medical and Human Services Public Law No. 113-5, forms the foundation of HHS legal\nIncident35 (HHS) authority for responding to public health emergencies (Public\nHealth Service Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq.). The Project\nBioShield Act amended the PHSA to provide flexible authorities\nto expedite and enhance research, development, procurement,\nand stockpiling of medical countermeasures for a biological\nincident (Public Law 108-276 (as amended at 21 U.S.C. §\n360bbb-3; 42 U.S.C. §§ 247d-6a, 247d-6b).\nThe EPA and USCG have the authority to take actions to\nrespond to oil discharges and releases of hazardous\nEnvironmental substances, pollutants, and contaminants, including leading\nOil and\nProtection Agency the response. (42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., 33 U.S.C. § 1251\nHazardous\n(EPA) or U.S. Coast et seq.). The EPA Administrator and Commandant of the\nMaterials Spills\nGuard (USCG) USCG36 may also classify an oil discharge as a spill of\nnational significance and designate senior officials to\nparticipate in the response. (40 CFR Part 300.323).37\nCyber Incident FBI, Office of the The FBI has the designation of federal lead agency for\n34 These and other department or agency authorities may be exercised independently of, concurrently with, or become\npart of a federal response coordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to Presidential directive. Other\ndepartment and agency authorities for specific incidents can be found in the FIOP’s incident annexes.\n35 A declaration of a public health emergency may make available any funds appropriated to the Public Health\nEmergency Fund.\n36 The Commandant of the USCG coordinates the designation of a spill of national significance with the Secretary of\nHomeland Security, as appropriate.\n37 See ESF #10 – Oil and Hazardous Materials Response Annex for more information on these authorities.\n45\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nScenario Department/Agency Authorities\nDirector of National threat response activities (PPD-41). Threat response\nIntelligence (ODNI), activities include the law enforcement and national security\nand DHS/CISA investigation of a cyber incident, including collecting\nevidence, linking related incidents, gathering intelligence,\nidentifying opportunities for threat pursuit and disruption,\nand providing attribution. ODNI, through the Cyber Threat\nintelligence Integration Center, is the lead federal agency for\nintelligence support and related activities. DHS has the\nresponsibility for asset response activities, such as\nproviding technical assets and assistance to mitigate\nvulnerabilities and reducing the impact of the incident,\nidentifying and assessing the risk posed to other entities and\nmitigating those risks, and providing guidance on how to\nleverage federal resources and capabilities (PPD-41). The\nCyber UCG will also include relevant sector-specific\nagencies if a cyber incident affects or is likely to affect the\nsectors they represent. FEMA maintains the responsibility\nfor coordinating consequence management for physical\nimpacts to the population.\nWhen a federal department or agency has responsibility for directing or managing a major aspect of a\nresponse coordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, that organization is part of the national\nleadership for the incident and is represented in field, regional, and headquarters unified command and\ncoordination organizations.\nFederal-to-Federal Support\nFederal departments and agencies may execute interagency or intra-agency reimbursable agreements\nin accordance with the Economy Act or other applicable authorities. The Financial Management\nSupport Annex to the NRF contains information about this process. A federal department or agency\nresponding to an incident under its own authorities may also request support from the Secretary of\nHomeland Security in obtaining and coordinating additional federal assistance. The Secretary of\nHomeland Security may activate one or more ESFs to provide the requested support.\nInternational Support\nFEMA, the Department of State, and other Federal agencies use the International Assistance Systems\nConcept of Operations to manage the acceptance or request of international resources following a\nStafford Act declaration. The Federal Government may execute a process to “pull” resources from\ninternational partners where the assistance meets known requirements identified by the local, state,\ntribal, territorial, insular or Federal officials in the disaster area based on a request from an authorized\nFederal response agency for resources that are urgently needed but not available in the United States.\nThe Federal Government may operate a “push” process when accepting the assistance that addresses\nFederal Government diplomatic interests even when foreign assistance has not been requested. The\nFederal Government only accepts commodities that can enter the country without significant regulatory\nagency oversight or inspection and that can readily be used. FEMA coordinates through the ESFs and\nwith regulatory agencies to ensure assets are appropriate to be applied to the disaster and meet statutory\nor regulatory requirements.\n46\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFederal Response and Assistance Available Without a Stafford Act\nDeclaration\nThe NRF covers the full range of complex and constantly changing requirements in anticipation of or\nin response to threats or actual incidents. In addition to Stafford Act support, the NRF or other\nsupplementary or complementary operational plans may be applied to respond or provide other forms\nof support. During a non-Stafford Act response:\n The President may designate, and departments and agencies may recommend through the\ninteragency policy process, an LFA to manage the incident.\n When an LFA is designated, the LFA appoints a senior response official to carry out its\nresponsibilities employing the NRF, NDRF, and NIMS. The senior response official is the Federal\nGovernment’s senior representative fully dedicated to the response, demonstrates national-level\nleadership in a time of crisis, and acts as the face and voice of the Federal response when interacting\nwith other senior Federal, state, tribal, territorial, or insular, private sector, nongovernmental, and\nelected officials as well as the media and the public.\n When directed by the President or requested by an agency head, FEMA’s incident management\ncapabilities may be used on a reimbursable basis under the Economy Act to support an LFA in\ncarrying out the aforementioned responsibilities. FEMA may adjust the scale of its support to\nensure execution of its statutory responsibilities.\nOperational Planning\nOperational planning is conducted across the whole community, including the private sector, NGOs,\nand all levels of government. Operational planning is guided by objectives and priorities identified in\nrelated strategic plans and an understanding of the risks that affect an organization or jurisdiction. The\nNRF fosters unity of effort for emergency operations planning by providing common doctrine and\npurpose, which integrates both the National Preparedness System and the National Planning System.\nPlanning is fundamental to national preparedness. Plans are a continuous, evolving instrument of\nanticipated actions that maximize opportunities and guide response operations. Because planning is an\nongoing process, a plan is a product based on information and understanding at the moment and is\nsubject to revision.\nThe National Planning System provides a unified approach and common terminology for deliberate\nand incident action planning. Deliberate planning involves developing strategic, operational, and\ntactical plans to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from a\njurisdiction’s threats or hazards. Incident action planning, sometimes referred to as crisis action\nplanning, occurs in a time-constrained environment to develop or rapidly adapt operational and tactical\nplans in response to an imminent or ongoing incident.38\nDeliberate plans provide the starting point for incident response and recovery and provide much of the\nrequired information for incident action planning, which is then adapted to meet operational conditions.\nThe planning process includes a feedback loop for continual refinement of deliberate and incident plans\nto more effectively address incident priorities and objectives. Incident plans are continually refined\n38 National Planning System, 2016, pages 4 and 5.\n47\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nthroughout an incident, based on emerging operational conditions. Incident plans can also support the\nmodification and improvement of deliberate plans through after-action and lessons-learned processes.\nResponse to emergencies and disasters will be most effective when communities conduct risk- and\ncapability-based planning. Support provided by the National Risk Management Center and tools such\nas the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment, Stakeholder Preparedness Review, and\nCore Capability Development Sheets help communities to set risk-based capability targets, evaluate\ncapability gaps, and develop strategies to build and sustain discrete capabilities. These activities inform\nresource investment and allocation, drive deliberate planning efforts focused on the most challenging\nrisks, and help government and private sector officials understand response and recovery capacities\nand identify where mutual aid or other assistance may fill capability gaps.\nThe National Planning System and Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 provide further\ninformation on the various types of plans and guidance on the fundamentals of planning.\nFederal Planning\nFederal planning is integrated to align, link, and synchronize response actions to enable federal\ndepartments and agencies and other national-level partners to provide the right resources at the right\ntime to support local, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area government response operations.\nIntegrated planning provides answers for which traditional and nontraditional partners can deliver\ncapabilities that stabilize community lifelines and ultimately support the recovery of the community.\nThe NRF is based on the concept of tiered response with an understanding that most incidents start at\nthe local or tribal level, and as needs exceed resources and capabilities, additional local, state, tribal,\nterritorial, insular area, or federal assets may be required. The FIOP for response and recovery,\ntherefore, is intended to align with other local, state, tribal, territorial, insular area government, and\nfederal plans to ensure that all response partners share a common operational focus. Similarly,\nintegration occurs at the federal level among the departments, agencies, and nongovernmental partners\nthat compose the respective mission area through the frameworks, FIOPs, and departmental and agency\noperations plans.\nFigure 6 provides an overview of how federal deliberate planning efforts are aligned under the National\nPreparedness System and are mutually supportive in their development, coordination, and use.\nSimilarly, complementary and mutually supportive plans may be developed by organizations through\nincident action planning.\n48\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nFigure 6: Alignment of Planning Efforts with PPD 8 – National Preparedness\nApplication for Planning\nImplementation of the concepts within the NRF and related FIOP are mandatory for federal\ndepartments and agencies. While the NRF does not direct the actions of other response elements, the\nguidance contained in the NRF and the FIOP is intended to inform local, state, tribal, territorial, and\ninsular area governments, as well as NGOs and the private sector, regarding how the Federal\nGovernment responds to incidents. These partners can use this information to inform their planning\nand ensure that assumptions regarding federal assistance and response and the manner in which federal\nsupport will be provided are accurate.\nAt the federal level, the NRF is supported by the FIOP. Incident annexes to the FIOP address unique\nconcepts of operations or capabilities for risks not otherwise addressed by the FIOP. The concepts in\nthe NRF and NIMS guide federal operational response planning and the FIOP, which provides further\ninformation regarding roles and responsibilities and identifies the critical tasks, resourcing, and\nsourcing requirements. The NRF does not contain detailed descriptions of specific department or\nagency functions because such information is located in department- or agency-level operational plans.\nFederal department and agency plans should, at a minimum, address the execution of their roles and\nresponsibilities in support of the NRF and FIOP to deliver the core capabilities.\n49\n\n\nNational Response Framework\nContinuity Considerations\nNational preparedness and sustainment of essential functions are a shared responsibility of the whole\ncommunity. Continuity considerations should be incorporated into the planning process. Continuity is\nnot strictly a governmental responsibility, nor is it limited to a specific critical infrastructure sector.\nEffective continuity planning helps to ensure the uninterrupted ability to engage partners; to respond\nappropriately with scaled, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities; to specify succession to\noffice and delegations of authority to protect the unity of effort and command; and to account for the\navailability of responders, regardless of the threat or hazard.39\nEnsuring the continuity of community lifeline operations is a critical part of responding to a disaster.\nContinuity planning and operations increase the likelihood of uninterrupted coordination across\njurisdictions, levels of government, and the private sector, particularly during catastrophic incidents.\nFor example, effective response operations require the operability, interoperability, and continuity of\ncommunications. The National Emergency Communications Plan provides the whole community with\na strategic plan that establishes a shared vision for and coordinates the complex mission of maintaining\nand improving emergency communications capabilities.\nContinuity considerations, including community lifeline interdependencies, should be built into all\nplans and guidance and supported by leadership at all levels. Without the implementation of continuity\nprinciples, private sector organizations and governments at all levels may be unable to provide services\nand sustainment of community lifelines when needed the most.\nSupporting Resources\nTo assist NRF users, FEMA maintains electronic versions of the current NRF documents—the base\ndocument, ESF annexes, and support annexes—as well as other supporting materials. FEMA also\nprovides information, training materials, and other tools, such as an overview of the main Stafford Act\nprovisions, a guide to authorities and references, and an abbreviations list to assist response partners\nin understanding and executing their roles under the NRF. Materials are regularly evaluated, updated,\nand augmented, as necessary. Additional content may be added or modified at the request of response\nmission area partners and other users.\nMaintenance\nThe NRF is a living document, and it will be regularly reviewed to evaluate consistency with existing\nand new policies, evolving conditions, and the experience gained from its use. Reviews will be\nconducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the NRF on a quadrennial basis.\nDHS will coordinate and oversee the review and maintenance process for the NRF. The revision\nprocess includes developing or updating documents necessary to carry out capabilities. Significant\nupdates to the NRF will be vetted through a federal senior-level interagency review process. The NRF\nwill be reviewed in order to accomplish the following:\n Assess and update information on the core capabilities in support of response goals and objectives;\n Ensure that the NRF adequately reflects the organization of responsible entities;\n Ensure that the NRF is consistent with the other four mission areas;\n Update processes based on changes in the national threat/hazard environment;\n39 For more information on continuity considerations, see https://www.fema.gov/continuity-guidance-circular-cgc.\n50\n\n\nNational Response Framework\n Incorporate lessons-learned and effective practices from day-to-day operations, exercises, and\nactual incidents and alerts; and\n Reflect progress in the Nation’s response mission activities the need to execute new laws,\nExecutive orders, and Presidential directives, as well as strategic changes to national priorities and\nguidance, critical tasks, or national capabilities.\nIn reviewing the implementation of the NRF, FEMA will consider effective practices and lessons-\nlearned from exercises and operations, as well as pertinent new processes and technologies. Effective\npractices include continuity planning, which ensures that the capabilities contained in the NRF can\ncontinue to be executed, regardless of the threat or hazard. Pertinent new processes and technologies\nshould enable the Nation to adapt efficiently to the evolving risk environment and use data relating to\nlocation, context, and interdependencies that allow for effective integration across all missions using a\nstandards-based approach. Updates to the NRF annexes may occur independently from reviews of the\nbase document.\nConclusion\nIn implementing the NRF to build national preparedness and resilience, partners are encouraged to\ndevelop a shared understanding of broad-level strategic implications as they make critical decisions in\nbuilding future capacity and capability. The whole community should be engaged in examining and\nimplementing the strategy and doctrine contained in the NRF, considering current and future\nrequirements in the process.\nThe whole community remains firm in its commitment to safeguard itself against its greatest risks, now\nand in the future. Through whole community engagement, the Nation will continue to improve its\npreparedness to face all emergencies or disaster challenges that may unfold.\n51",
