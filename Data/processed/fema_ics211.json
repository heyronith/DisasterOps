The ICS 211 is initiated at a number of incident locations including: Staging Areas, Base, and Incident\nCommand Post (ICP). Preparation may be completed by: (1) overhead at these locations, who record the information\nand give it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (2) the Incident Communications Center Manager located in the\nCommunications Center, who records the information and gives it to the Resources Unit as soon as possible, (3) a\nrecorder from the Resources Unit during check-in to the ICP. As an option, the ICS 211 can be printed on colored paper\nto match the designated Resource Status Card (ICS 219) colors. The purpose of this is to aid the process of completing a\nlarge volume of ICS 219s. The ICS 219 colors are:\n• 219-1: Header Card – Gray (used only as label cards for T-Card racks)\n• 219-2: Crew/Team Card – Green\n• 219-3: Engine Card – Rose\n• 219-4: Helicopter Card – Blue\n• 219-5: Personnel Card – White\n• 219-6: Fixed-Wing Card – Orange\n• 219-7: Equipment Card – Yellow\n• 219-8: Miscellaneous Equipment/Task Force Card – Tan\n• 219-10: Generic Card – Light Purple\nDistribution.
