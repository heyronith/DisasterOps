Video\nTranscript - What is NIMS?\nEach day communities respond to numerous emergencies. Most often, these incidents are\nmanaged effectively at the local level. However, there are some incidents that may require a\ncollaborative approach includes personnel from:\n• Multiple jurisdictions\n• A combination of specialties or disciplines\n• Several levels of government\n• Nongovernmental organizations\n• The private sector\nThe National Incident Management System, or NIMS, provides the foundation needed to ensure\nthat we can work together when our communities and the Nation need us the most.\nNIMS integrates best practices into a comprehensive, standardized framework that is flexible\nenough to be applicable across the full spectrum of potential incidents, regardless of cause, size,\nlocation, or complexity.\nUsing NIMS allows us to work together to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and\nmitigate the effects of incidents.\nThis course introduces you to the NIMS concepts, principles, and components.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-14\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 3: NIMS Overview\nWHAT? The National Incident Management System\n(NIMS) defines the comprehensive approach guiding…\nWHO? …the whole community - solutions that serve\nthe entire community are implemented while\nsimultaneously making sure that the resources the\ndifferent members of the community bring to the table\nare leveraged across all levels of government,\nnongovernmental organizations (NGO), and private\nsector organizations to work together seamlessly\nWHY? …to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond\nto, and recover from the effects of incidents.\nWHEN? NIMS applies to all incidents, regardless of\ncause, size, location, or complexity, from planned\nevents to traffic accidents and to major disasters.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-15\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 4: Voices of Experience: NIMS Benefits\nVoices of Experience: NIMS Benefits\nSteve Grainer, Former Chief, Incident Management Programs, VA Dept. of Fire Programs\nNIMS is a national initiative to standardize the fundamental processes that are necessary for\neffectively managing significant emergencies, and it’s applicable in all size and scale and scope\nemergencies.\nHaving been involved at the local, State, and Federal level in a number of different venues\nduring my career, I’m truly and honestly pleased to say that this is an opportunity for us all to\nbetter establish a baseline of competencies for not only emergencies, obviously that would be the\nprimary focus, but also to utilize a nationally vetted process that will work given A) participation\nand B) commitment. So I’m all for the idea of establishing a national systems approach as is\npretty much formatted through the concepts of NIMS in their entirety. It’s a good thing, that’s\nabout the best I can say.\nCurry Mayer, Former Training & Exercise Chief, Governor’s Office of Emergency\nServices (CA)\nNIMS is the national structure that includes roles and responsibilities for responding to an\nincident that would require the Federal Government to be involved, a catastrophic or large-scale\nincident. It’s also a system that provides common terminology, roles, and responsibilities so that\neveryone in the country can basically plug into the national system of response.\nKristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-16\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nNIMS has helped us be better structured, have less duplication, be more organized and more\nefficient and it covers the whole gambit of organization, communications, preparedness, it’s the\nwhole, it’s everything.\nRoberta Runge, National NIMS Coordinator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nNIMS is a system that allows us to plan and prepare and execute a response more effectively\nwith our response partners.\nThe biggest benefit to us as an agency is to be able to understand how our response partners are\nalso going to be executing the response. EPA is a fairly large organization but we hardly ever\nrespond to something very large and very complicated without other Federal and State and local\npartners. If everyone is operating the response using different terminology or a different\nmanagement structure, it becomes very difficult, very fast.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-17\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 5: NIMS Applicability and Scope\nNIMS is a common framework for emergency management and\nincident response that is applicable to all stakeholders with\nincident related responsibilities.\nThe audience for NIMS includes:\n• Emergency responders\n• Other incident personnel\n• Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) such as faith-\nbased and community-based groups\n• The private sector\n• Elected and appointed officials\n• People with disabilities or access and functional needs\nThe scope of NIMS includes:\n• All incidents, regardless of size, complexity, or scope\n• Planned events such as sporting events\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-18\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 6: Overview of NIMS\nThe National Incident Management System (NIMS) defines the comprehensive approach guiding\nthe whole community - all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and the\nprivate sector - to work together seamlessly to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and\nrecover from the effects of incidents.\nNIMS Is NIMS Is Not\n• A comprehensive, nationwide, systematic • Only the Incident Command System\napproach to incident management, including\n• Only applicable to certain\nthe command and coordination of incidents,\nemergency/incident response personnel\nresource management, and information\nmanagement • A static system\n• A set of concepts and principles for all • A response plan\nthreats, hazards, and events across all\nmission areas (Prevention, Protection,\nMitigation, Response, Recovery)\n• Scalable, flexible, and adaptable; used for • Used only during large-scale incidents\nall incidents, from day-to-day to large-scale\n• Standard resource management procedures • A resource ordering system\nthat enable coordination among different\njurisdictions or organizations\n• Essential principles for communications and • A communications plan\ninformation management\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-19\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 7: Discussion Question\nWhat are some common features of NIMS?\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-20\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 8: NIMS Guiding Principles\nIncident management is the application of resources by\norganizations to plan for, respond to, and recover from an\nincident.\nPriorities for incident management in planning, response, and\nrecovery efforts include saving lives, stabilizing the incident,\nand protecting property and the environment.\nTo achieve these priorities, incident management personnel\nuse NIMS components in accordance with three NIMS\nguiding principles:\n• Flexibility\n• Standardization\n• Unity of Effort\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-21\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 9: Flexibility\nThe NIMS guiding principle of flexibility\nallows NIMS to be scalable from routine, local\nincidents through those requiring interstate\nmutual aid up to those requiring Federal\nassistance.\nFlexibility enables NIMS to be applicable to\nincidents that vary widely in terms of hazard,\ngeography, demographics, climate, cultural,\nand organizational authorities.\nNIMS components are adaptable to any type of\nevent or incident.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-22\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 10: Standardization\nThe NIMS guiding principle of standardization supports\ninteroperability among multiple organizations in incident\nresponse.\nNIMS defines standard organizational structures that\nimprove integration and connectivity among\norganizations.\nNIMS defines standard practices that allow incident\npersonnel and organizations to work together effectively.\nNIMS includes common terminology, which enables\neffective communication.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-23\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 11: Unity of Effort\nThe NIMS guiding principle of Unity of Effort means\ncoordinating activities among various organizational\nrepresentatives to achieve common objectives.

The major Components of\nNIMS provide a common framework to\nintegrate these diverse capabilities and achieve\ncommon goals.\n• Resource Management\n• Command and Coordination\n• Communications and Information\nManagement\nThe application of all three components is vital\nto successful NIMS implementation.\nFollowing is a synopsis of each major component of NIMS:\n• Resource Management. Resources (such as personnel, equipment,\nand/or supplies) are needed to support critical incident objectives.\nNote The flow of resources must be fluid and adaptable to the requirements\nof the incident. NIMS defines standardized mechanisms and\nestablishes the resource management process to: identify\nrequirements for, order and acquire, mobilize, track and report,\nrecover and demobilize, reimburse for, and inventory resources.\n• Command and Coordination. The Command and Management\ncomponent within NIMS is designed to enable effective and efficient\nincident management and coordination by providing flexible,\nstandardized incident management structures. The structure is based\non three key organizational constructs: the Incident Command\nSystem, Multiagency Coordination Systems, and Public Information.\n• Communications and Information Management. Emergency\nmanagement and incident response activities rely on communications\nand information systems that provide a common operating picture to\nall command and coordination sites. NIMS describes the\nrequirements necessary for a standardized framework for\ncommunications and emphasizes the need for a common operating\npicture. NIMS is based on the concepts of interoperability, reliability,\nscalability, portability, and the resiliency and redundancy of\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-25\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\ncommunications and information systems.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-26\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 13: Discussion Question\nWhat actions does your organization take that exemplify NIMS best practices?\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-27\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 14: Lesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of\nNIMS Summary\nThis lesson presented an overview of the Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS.\nThe lesson specifically discussed:\n• An Introduction and Background to NIMS\n• NIMS Applicability and Scope\n• NIMS Guiding Principles\n• An Overview of the NIMS components\nThe next lesson will introduce you to NIMS Resource Management.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-28\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-29\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nReference\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS), October 2017.\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-30\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 1: Lesson 2: NIMS Resource Management\nThis lesson presents an overview of NIMS Resource Management.\nObjectives:\nAt the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n• Describe the four key activities of NIMS Resource Management Preparedness.\n• Identify the methods for Managing Resources during an Incident.\n• Describe features of Mutual Aid.\n(National Incident Management System, Third Edition, October 2017)\nhttps://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/148019\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-31\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 2: What is NIMS Resource Management?\nVideo\nDuring an incident, getting the right resources, to the right place, at the right time, can be a\nmatter of life and death.\nTranscript - What is NIMS Resource Management?\nDuring an incident, getting the right resources, to the right place, at the right time, can be a\nmatter of life and death.\nResource management involves collaboration and coordination across jurisdictions and\norganizations to systematically manage resources—including personnel, equipment, teams,\nsupplies and facilities.\nSince most jurisdictions or organizations cannot own and maintain all of the resources necessary\nto address all potential threats and hazards, effective resource management includes leveraging\neach jurisdiction’s resources and encouraging the further development of mutual aid agreements.\nResource management preparedness involves four key activities: identifying and typing\nresources; qualifying, certifying, and credentialing personnel; planning for resources; and\nacquiring, storing, and inventorying resources.\nPrior to an incident, resources are inventoried and categorized based on the characteristics\nof capability, category, kind and type.\nMutual aid partners exchange information about resource assets and needs. Resource readiness\nand credentialing are maintained through periodic training and exercises.\nWhen an incident occurs, standardized procedures are used to:\n• Identify resource requirements,\n• Order and acquire resources, and\n• Mobilize resources.\nThe purpose of tracking and reporting is accountability. Resource accountability helps ensure\nresponder safety and effective use of incident resources. As incident objectives are reached,\nresources may no longer be necessary. At this point, the demobilization process begins.\nDemobilization is the orderly, safe, and efficient return of an incident resource to its original\nlocation and status. Finally, reimbursement and restocking activities ensure that resource\nproviders are paid for their expenses and resources that have been depleted are replenished.\nWhen disaster strikes, we must be able to take full advantage of all available and qualified\nresources. In this lesson you will learn how NIMS provides the mechanisms for ensuring that we\ncan be inclusive and integrate resources from all levels of government, the private sector, and\nnongovernmental organizations.\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-32\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 3: Resource Management Key Activities\nOverview\nResource management preparedness involves four key activities:\n• Identifying and typing resources\n• Qualifying, certifying, and credentialing personnel\n• Planning for resources\n• Acquiring, storing, and inventorying resources\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-33\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 4: Typing Resources\nResource typing defines and categorizes incident resources\nby capability.\nResource typing establishes common definitions for\ncapabilities of personnel, equipment, teams, supplies, and\nfacilities.\nTyping definitions include the following information:\nCapability: the resource's capability to perform its function\nin one or more of the five mission areas: Prevention,\nProtection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery.\nCategory: the function for which a resource would be most\nuseful (e.g., firefighting, law enforcement, health and\nmedical).\nKind: a broad characterization, such as personnel,\nequipment, teams, and facilities.\nType: a resource's level of capability to perform its function\nbased on size, power, capacity (for equipment), or\nexperience and qualifications; Type 1 has greater capacity\nthan Type 2, 3, or 4.\nThe current FEMA Resource Management and Mutual Aid\nlink contains information on NIMS Resource Typing and\nCredentialing: http://www.fema.gov/resource-\nmanagement-mutual-aid\nThe NIMS Resource Typing Library Tool, also available at\nthe link above, is an online catalog of all NIMS resource\ntyping definitions and job titles/position qualifications that\nhave been released by FEMA.\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-34\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 5: Discussion Question\nWhat are the benefits of typing resources?\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-35\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 6: Qualifying, Certifying and Credentialing\nPersonnel\nThe Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) has the authority and responsibility for qualification,\ncertification, and credentialing within its organization or jurisdiction.\nThe establishment of national standards provide common, compatible structures for the\nqualification and certification of emergency management personnel.\nQualification, certification, and credentialing are the essential steps to help ensure that personnel\ndeploying under mutual aid agreements can perform their assigned roles.\n• Qualifying: Personnel meet the minimum established standards (including training,\nexperience, physical and medical fitness) to fill specific positions.\n• Certification: recognition from an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) or a third party\nthat an individual has completed qualification for a position (one example of a third party\nis an accredited body such as a state licensure board for medical professionals).\n• Credentialing: documentation – typically an identification card or badge – that\nidentifies personnel and verifies their qualifications for a particular position.\nNIMS Overview of Supporting Tools and Aids: www.fema.gov/nims-doctrine-supporting-\nguides-tools\nNIMS Guidelines for Credentialing Personnel are in PDF at:\nhttp://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/nims_cred_guidelines_report.pdf\nAuthority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)\nDefinition: An entity that has the authority and responsibility for developing,\nimplementing, maintaining, and overseeing the qualification process within\nits organization or jurisdiction. This may be a state or Federal agency,\nNote\ntraining commission, NGO, private sector company, or a tribal or local\nagency such as a police, fire, or public works department.

We know each\njurisdiction is going to have to have some resources available\nbut they’re never going to have enough, there is always going\nto be shortfalls, and part of resource management is to manage\nthose gaps in the availability of the resources. So, resource\nmanagement under NIMS gives us a structure and a process to\nbe able to do that. Part of it was the resource typing, so it\nstreamlines the requesting of equipment, particularly among\ndifferent jurisdictions and agencies. If I ask for a particular type\nof vehicle with certain equipment and with the right number of\npeople, then I only need to make one request and I’ll get all of\nthat. If there is something else, I ask for a different type of\nequipment. So the typing is going to help us tremendously\nunder resource management. It also requires that we do\ninventories. Inventories let us know what equipment we have\non hand. We compare that to what we think we’re going to need\nbased on our planning and our exercising, we identified some of\nthe gaps, and then we start looking for ways of filling those\nshortfalls. Mutual aid is one of those activities under resource\nmanagement that is important in helping us use resources across\nlevels, among different agencies, helps the taxpayers, helps the\nresponders, helps the whole Nation.\"\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-41\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 12: Voices of Experience:\nResource Management Words of Advice\nRon Britton, Former NIMS Coordinator, FEMA, Region 10\n\"Resource management is much bigger than just identifying and\nmoving vehicles or planes or so forth, that really, really involves\nthe entire credentialing process of knowing all of our personnel\nresources capabilities and training background and so forth, that\nall needs to be done in a prior preparation event, so that we\nreally know that when those folks arrive on scene, they’re\ncapable of doing the job we’re asking them to do. So it starts\nwith those folks, their credentialing, their qualifications, and then\nas well knowing the types of equipment that we would need to\nhave on scene. So the equipment and the things that need to be\nthere, and that would go under the communications as well\nbecause resource typing would involve the radios, the satellite\nphones, and all of the kinds of support communications that we\nwould need for something to respond.

One of the problems with mutual aid\nin the past has been a common terminology, a common\nnomenclature, speaking the same language. One term to one\nparticular level of government doesn’t necessarily mean the\nsame thing to another, and NIMS addresses those particular\ntypes of issues. We all try to speak in a common language, plain\nEnglish. The other real benefit that NIMS can bring is resource\ntyping. We all know that when you need something that is not\nreadily available within your jurisdiction, you need it fast. It\nspeeds up the process when a person that has an asset can\nunderstand very quickly what you are asking for, and if those\nresources are typed, the benefit to one of the NIMS requirements\nis that a person requesting something and asks for it knows what\nthey are going to get when they follow a typing scheme.\"\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-58\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 28: Mutual Aid Agreements and Compacts\nMutual aid agreements establish the legal basis for two or more entities to share resources.\nVarious forms of mutual aid agreements and compacts exist among and between all levels of\ngovernment in the United States.\nThese agreements may authorize mutual aid:\n• Between two or more neighboring communities\n• Among all jurisdictions within an state\n• Between States, Territories and Tribal Governments\n• Between Federal agencies\n• Internationally\n• Between government and NGOs and/or the private sector\n• Among NGOs and/or private sector entities\nMutual Aid Agreements and Compacts (Continued)\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)\nEMAC is a congressionally ratified mutual aid compact that defines a non-\nNote Federal, state-to-state system for sharing resources across state lines during\nan emergency or disaster.

EEI ensures incident\npersonnel gather the most accurate and appropriate data,\ntranslate it into useful information, and communicate it with\nappropriate personnel.\nThe collection, analysis, and sharing of incident-related information are\nimportant activities for all incidents. Typically, staff in the Planning Section\nare responsible for gathering and analyzing operational information and\nsharing situational awareness, and staff in the Operations Section are\nresponsible for executing tactical activities. However, some incidents involve\nintensive intelligence gathering and investigative activity, and for such\nincidents, the Incident Commander or Unified Command may opt to\nreconfigure intelligence/investigations responsibilities to meet the needs of\nthe incident. This may occur when the incident involves a criminal or\nterrorist act and/or other non-law-enforcement intelligence/investigations\nInstructor\nefforts such as epidemiological investigations.\nNote\nFor additional information see the following website:\nhttps://www.fema.gov/nims-doctrine-supporting-guides-tools.\nIn NIMS, “intelligence” refers exclusively to threat-related information\ndeveloped by law enforcement, medical surveillance, and other investigative\norganizations.\nNote\nLesson 3: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-80\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 17: Activity 2.1: NIMS Management\nCharacteristics\nInstructions:\n1.

ICS is one of the four NIMS\nstructures. Before we explore ICS, let's briefly look at all four NIMS structures.\n“NIMS is a system to provide a framework for all of the team to work together towards common\ngoals.” Craig Fugate, former FEMA Administrator (and past Director, FL Division of\nEmergency Management).\nWhat is NIMS Command and Coordination?\nThere are three major components of the NIMS framework:\n• Resource Management\n• Command and Coordination\n• Communications and Information Management\nTogether these NIMS components provide a framework for effective management during\nincident response.\nYou have already explored Resource Management and the 14 NIMS Management\nCharacteristics. Next, we’ll cover the NIMS structures that enable incident managers to manage\nand coordinate incident response in a unified, consistent manner.\nThe four NIMS Structures are: the Incident Command System, Emergency Operations Centers,\nthe Multi-Agency Coordination Group, and the Joint Information System. Together, these four\nelements comprise the NIMS Command and Coordination structures.\nMultiagency Coordination Systems, or MACS, is an overarching term for the four NIMS\nCommand and Coordination systems: ICS, EOCs, MAC Group and JIS.\nThe Incident Command System, or ICS, is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazard incident\nmanagement concept. ICS allows its users to adopt an integrated organizational structure to\nmatch the complexities and demands of incidents.\nAs an incident becomes more complex, multiagency coordination and the need for additional\nresources becomes increasingly important. Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) support on-\nscene incident command from off-site through multiagency coordination and resources.\nMAC Groups are high level multiagency coordination bodies that support ICS and EOCs\nthrough policy and scarce resource allocation.\nThe final Command and Coordination element is the Joint Information System (JIS). The Joint\nInformation System ensures coordinated and accurate public messaging among the ICS, EOCs\nand MAC Group.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-86\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nNIMS is summed up by former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate: [“. . .when we fail to work as\na team, we fail our citizens … NIMS is a system to provide a framework for all of the team to\nwork together towards common goals.”]\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-87\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 3: NIMS Command and Coordination\nStructures\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-88\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 4: NIMS Command and Coordination\nStructures (Continued)\nNIMS structures enable incident managers to manage incidents in a unified, consistent manner.\nWhen an incident occurs or threatens, local emergency personnel manage response using ICS.\nIf the incident is large or complex, off-site EOCs activate to support on-scene operations.\nThe incident personnel in the field and in EOCs receive policy guidance from MAC Groups.\nA Joint Information Center manages the Joint Information System (JIS) to ensure coordinated\nand accurate public messaging among all levels: ICS, EOC and MAC Group.\nThe first NIMS structure we will examine is ICS.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-89\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 5: Voices of Experience: Incident Command\nSystem\n\"ICS is a system to allow responders to be able to organize and respond to an incident.

In large-scale incidents or where\nmultiple command posts are established, the Public Information Officer\nshould participate in or lead the Joint Information Center in order to ensure\nconsistency in the provision of information to the public.\nSafety Officer\nThe Safety Officer monitors incident operations and advises the Incident\nCommander/Unified Command on all matters relating to operational safety,\nincluding the health and safety of emergency responder personnel. The\nNote\nultimate responsibility for the safe conduct of incident management\noperations rests with the Incident Commander/Unified Command and\nsupervisors at all levels of incident management. The Safety Officer is, in\nturn, responsible to the Incident Commander/Unified Command for the\nsystems and procedures necessary to ensure ongoing assessment of\nhazardous environments, including the incident Safety Plan, coordination of\nmultiagency safety efforts, and implementation of measures to promote\nemergency responder safety, as well as the general safety of incident\noperations. The Safety Officer has immediate authority to stop and/or prevent\nunsafe acts during incident operations. It is important to note that the\nagencies, organizations, or jurisdictions that contribute to joint safety\nmanagement efforts do not lose their individual identities or responsibility\nfor their own programs, policies, and personnel. Rather, each contributes to\nthe overall effort to protect all responder personnel involved in incident\noperations.\nLiaison Officer\nThe Liaison Officer is Incident Command’s point of contact for\nrepresentatives of other governmental agencies, nongovernmental\norganizations, and the private sector (with no jurisdiction or legal authority)\nNote\nto provide input on their agency’s policies, resource availability, and other\nincident-related matters. Under either a single Incident Commander or a\nUnified Command structure, representatives from assisting or cooperating\nagencies and organizations coordinate through the Liaison Officer. Agency\nand organizational representatives assigned to an incident must have the\nauthority to speak for their parent agencies or organizations on all matters,\nfollowing appropriate consultations with their agency leadership. Assistants\nand personnel from other agencies or organizations (public or private)\ninvolved in incident management activities may be assigned to the Liaison\nOfficer to facilitate coordination.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-99\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 14: General Staff Overview\nThe General Staff is a group of incident management personnel organized\naccording to function.\nThe ICS General Staff consists of 4 Sections:\nNote • Operations\n• Planning\n• Logistics\n• Finance/Administration\nEach ICS General Staff Section is led by a Section Chief who reports directly\nto the Incident Commander or Unified Command.\nThese individuals are responsible for managing tasks within their functional\narea.\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command activates these section chiefs\nas needed.\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command is responsible to perform\neach General Staff function until a section chief is assigned to manage that\nfunction.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-100\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 15: General Staff Sections\nGeneral Staff Sections\nOperations Section\nThe Operations Section plans and performs tactical activities to achieve the\nNote incident objectives established by the IC/UC.\nIncident objectives typically focus on:\n• Saving lives\n• Reducing the immediate hazard\n• Protecting property and the environment\n• Establishing situational control\n• Restoring normal operations\nPlanning Section\nPlanning Section personnel collect, evaluate, and disseminate incident\ninformation to the Incident Commander/Unified Command and other\nincident personnel.\nPlanning Section staff:\n• Prepare status reports\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-101\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\n• Display situation information\n• Maintain the status of assigned resources\n• Facilitate the incident action planning process\n• Prepare the Incident Action Plan (IAP) based on input from the\nGeneral Staff, Command Staff and Incident Commander/Unified\nCommand guidance.\nLogistics Section\nLogistics Section personnel are responsible for providing services and\nsupport for the incident.\nLogistics Section staff provide:\n• Facilities Security (of the incident command facilities and personnel)\n• Transportation\n• Supplies\n• Equipment maintenance and fuel\n• Food services\n• Communications and information technology support\n• Medical services for incident personnel\nFinance/Administration Section\nThe Incident Commander/Unified Command establishes a\nFinance/Administration Section when the incident management activities\nrequire on-scene or incident-specific finance and administrative support\nservices.\nFinance/Administration Section Staff:\n• Record personnel time\n• Negotiate leases\n• Maintain vendor contracts\n• Administer claims\n• Track and analyze incident costs\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-102\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 16: Common Types of ICS Facilities\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command\ndetermines the kinds and locations of ICS\nfacilities based on what is required to\nsupport the incident.\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command\nmay establish several different kinds of\nfacilities in and around the incident area.\nCommon Types of ICS Facilities (Continued)\nCommon ICS facilities:\n• The Incident Command Post (ICP) -

Examples\ninclude two or more hazardous materials spills, fires, etc. Often these\nkinds of incidents will vie for the same resources.\nNote\n• When an incident expands to a large geographic area, the agency\nofficials may choose to divide the incident into smaller pieces, called\nzones, each of which will be managed by an Incident Management\nTeam (IMT).\n• When incidents are of different kinds and/or do not have similar\nresource demands, they will usually be handled as separate incidents\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-107\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nor will be coordinated through an Emergency Operations Center\n(EOC).\nThe use of an Area Command makes the jobs of Incident Commanders and\nagency officials easier for the following reasons:\n• Much of the cross-incident coordination typically performed by each\nIncident Commander is accomplished at the Area Command level.\nUsing an Area Command allows the Incident Commanders and their\nIMTs to focus attention on their incident objectives, strategies, and\ntactics.\n• Area Command sets priorities between incidents and ensures efficient\nresource use. Critical resources are allocated by the overall priorities\nestablished by the agency officials. Competition among incidents for\ncritical resources is avoided. Often, agency dispatchers will recognize\ncross-incident coordination problems first.\n• Area Command ensures that agency policies, priorities, constraints,\nand guidance are being made known to the Incident Commanders and\nimplemented consistently across incidents.\n• Area Command also reduces the workload of Executives/Senior\nOfficials, especially if there are multiple incidents going on at the\nsame time.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-108\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 21: Discussion Question\nWhat are some examples when Area Commands have been established?\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-109\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 22: Discussion Question\nWhat are the commonalities between Area Command and Unified Command?

And\nthere is the requirement that not only do you, are you aware of\nwhat the system is but that you practice it, that you have some\ntraining in it so you’re not only, so it’s not just a check the box\nbut that you are actually able to perform a role in the system and\nensure that the public is secured for in a large event.\"\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-136\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 9: Joint Information System (JIS) Purpose\nThe Joint Information System (JIS) is the\nfourth NIMS Command and Coordination\nstructure.\nJIS integrates incident information and public\naffairs into a unified organization that provides\nconsistent, coordinated, accurate, accessible,\ntimely and complete information to the public\nand stakeholders during incident operations.\nJIS operates across and supports the other\nNIMS Command and Coordination structures:\nICS, EOC and MAC Group.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-137\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nJoint Information System (JIS) Purpose - Continued - ILT\nONLY\nJoint Information System (JIS) Purpose (Continued)\nJIS activities include:\n• Developing and delivering coordinated interagency messages\nNote\n• Developing, recommending and executing public information plans\nand strategies\n• Advise on public affairs issues that could affect the incident\nmanagement effort\n• Addressing and managing rumors and inaccurate information that\ncould undermine public confidence\nThe JIS performs these activities in support of the Incident Commander or\nUnified Command, the EOC Director, and the MAC Group.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-138\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 10: JIS Description and Components: PIO and\nJIC\nThe Public Information Officer (PIO) and Joint Information Center (JIC) are two supporting\nelements of the JIS.\nThe PIO is a key member of ICS and EOC organizations, though they might go by a different\ntitle in EOCs.

So different agencies that, it might be that you have, you know, transportation and\nfood and agriculture that are involved in the event so what are, what those public, the public\ninformation message, although one coordinated message needs to include the elements from\nthose different agencies that are involved, and who are the stakeholders, who are the people that\nhave been impacted, and ensuring that your message is coordinated so that everyone that needs\nto have some kind of information about the event gets what they need from that. The new thing\nfor NIMS is that each level of government and each agency involved has a public information\nresponsibility, but they come together and have one, one message that comes out.\nBill Campbell, Former Director of Training, NY State Emergency Management Office\nPublic information is number one, it’s one of the command staff positions within the ICS\nstructures so that tells you right up front that in the incident command system we place a lot of\nemphasis on public information and information in general. I think the importance and\nsignificance of public information is higher and greater now than it’s ever been in our history.\nYou’ve got to have a coordinated way to get a consistent message out. We’ve got to be very\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-142\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nclear and concise in our message to the public as to what we want them to do. Public information\nis more than just the public, it’s also the response community too.\nDaryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, Brazos River Authority, TX\nWe need to have a single point of contact for the media so that we can get our information out to\nthe general public. We use the media to get our message out. The citizens of our jurisdiction\nexpect information from us. They want to know what we’re doing, want to know why we are\ndoing things, and more important they want to know what they should be doing. We also found\nout that if the media isn’t kept in the loop, they are going to go out and start finding stories\nthemselves, finding out information themselves, that means then that we are losing control of the\nmessage. The message is being developed by the individual reporters in the media and that’s\ngoing to start confusing our citizens and get the wrong message to them. We need a coordinated\neffort for public information for the safety of the public and the security of the public and that’s\nwhat public information allows us to do.\nRon Britton, Former NIMS Coordinator, FEMA, Region 10\nPublic information is for public safety. We really want that information for people in the\nenvirons as well as people who are part of the response community to know what the situation is.\nThey need to know that to stay safe and to perform best. It can also be used to establish\ninformation exchanged with the local public to know evacuation routes, where the hospitals they\nshould go to—any number of things that would be of safety interest to the public. One of the\nreasons it was developed was to provide a consistent message so that different people in different\nparts of the organization aren’t reporting just what they are seeing, but that there is a centralized\nsystem that allows that information to be one-stop shopping and one message that goes out to the\npublic to keep everyone informed, and that’s all very, very safety related, and I think that’s a real\nkey point.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-143\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 14: Discussion Question\nWhy is it important that the JIS operates across and support the other NIMS Command and\nCoordination structures?\nWho would you include in your Joint Information System?\nWhat are the supporting elements of the JIS?\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-144\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 15: Interconnectivity of NIMS Command and\nCoordination Structures\nNIMS structures enable incident managers to\nmanage incidents in a unified, consistent\nmanner.\nInterconnectivity of NIMS structures is\nimportant to allow personnel in diverse\ngeographic areas, with differing roles and\nresponsibilities, and operating within various\nfunctions of ICS and/or EOCs to integrate their\nefforts through common organizational\nstructures, terminology, and processes.\nIf required resources are not available locally, they can be obtained under\nmutual aid agreements from neighboring jurisdictions, or State, tribal,\nterritorial, and interstate sources and assigned to the control of the Incident\nNote\nCommander or Unified Command.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-145\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 16: Interconnectivity of NIMS Command and\nCoordination Structures (Continued)\n• When an incident occurs or threatens,\nlocal emergency personnel manage\nresponse using NIMS principles and\nICS.\n• If the incident is or becomes large or\ncomplex, local EOCs activate.\n• EOCs receive senior level guidance\nfrom MAC Groups.\n• A Joint Information Center (JIC)\nmanages the Joint Information System\n(JIS) operations to ensure coordinated\nand accurate public messaging among\nall levels: ICS, EOC and MAC Group.\nNIMS structures enable incident\nmanagers to manage incidents in a\nunified, consistent manner.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-146\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 17: Federal Support to Response Activities\nThe Federal Government has a variety of capabilities and resources to support domestic\nincidents.\nMost incidents are resolved using capabilities available from the local jurisdiction.\nLarger incidents are resolved with support from by neighboring jurisdictions, or State, tribal,\nterritorial, and interstate sources.\nThe Federal Government only becomes involved with a response:\n• When state governors or tribal leaders request Federal assistance and their requests are\napproved\n• When Federal interests are involved\n• As statute or regulation authorizes or requires\nIn most cases the Federal Government plays a supporting role to state, tribal, or territorial\ngovernments by providing Federal assistance to the affected jurisdictions.\nFor example, the Federal Government provides assistance under the Robert T.

In New Orleans, most of the city was flooded. The\ncombined effects of wind, rain, storm surge, breached levees, and flooding knocked out virtually\nthe entire infrastructure—electrical power, roads, water supply and sewage, and communications\nsystems.\n[Thomas Stone, Fire Chief, St. Bernard Parish: “We lost our communications system, and when\nyou are not able to communicate, you can’t coordinate your response. You never think that you\nwill lose your entire infrastructure.”]\nCommunications problems are not limited to systems being destroyed or not functioning. Similar\nproblems arise when agencies cannot exchange needed information because of incompatible\nsystems. NIMS identifies several important features of public safety communications and\ninformation systems.\nCommunications systems need to be . . .\nInteroperable—able to communicate within and across agencies and jurisdictions.\nReliable—able to function in the context of any kind of emergency.\nScalable—suitable for use on a small or large scale as the needs of the incident dictate.\nPortable—built on standardized radio technologies, protocols, and frequencies.\nResilient—able to perform despite damaged or lost infrastructure.\nRedundant—able to use alternate communications methods when primary systems go\nout.\nSecure—able to protect sensitive or classified information from those without a need to\nknow.\nRegardless of the communications hardware being used, standardized procedures, protocols, and\nformats are necessary to gather, collate, synthesize, and disseminate incident information. And in\na crisis, life-and-death decisions depend on the information we receive.\nLesson 7: Communications and Information Management SM-154\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National

update incident information\ncontinually.\nEffective incident management relies on flexible communications and information systems that\nprovide accurate, timely, and relevant information.\nDuring an incident, this integrated approach:\n• Links all incident personnel, whether on-scene, in an EOC, or in another support location\n• Maintains communications connectivity and situational awareness\nFour key communications and information systems principles support the ability of incident\nmanagers to maintain this constant flow of information during an incident:\n• Interoperability\n•

If\nyou can’t talk to each other, you are not going to be able to\nwork together. So, part of the interoperability is making sure\nthat our equipment is compatible. We can talk. The second part\nof equipment compatibility is that the equipment works\ntogether. You can’t take a fire truck that has a 6-inch hose and\ntry to put it to a fire hydrant that operates with a 4-inch\nconnector. So if I take my truck from my facility and I bring it\nout to help you, if I can’t get the water pumped in, if I can’t\nhook our systems together, we’re not going to be able to work\nin a coordinated effort. Second thing is interoperability between\npeople and organizations. Part of that is the verbal\ncommunications where I say something, use a particular term,\nand it means the same thing to you.

Resource readiness\nand credentialing are maintained through periodic training and exercises.\nWhen an incident occurs, standardized procedures are used to:\n• Identify resource requirements,\n• Order and acquire resources, and\n• Mobilize resources.\nThe purpose of tracking and reporting is accountability. Resource accountability helps ensure\nresponder safety and effective use of incident resources. As incident objectives are reached,\nresources may no longer be necessary. At this point, the demobilization process begins.\nDemobilization is the orderly, safe, and efficient return of an incident resource to its original\nlocation and status. Finally, reimbursement and restocking activities ensure that resource\nproviders are paid for their expenses and resources that have been depleted are replenished.\nWhen disaster strikes, we must be able to take full advantage of all available and qualified\nresources. In this lesson you will learn how NIMS provides the mechanisms for ensuring that we\ncan be inclusive and integrate resources from all levels of government, the private sector, and\nnongovernmental organizations.\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-32"

We know each\njurisdiction is going to have to have some resources available\nbut they’re never going to have enough, there is always going\nto be shortfalls, and part of resource management is to manage\nthose gaps in the availability of the resources. So, resource\nmanagement under NIMS gives us a structure and a process to\nbe able to do that. Part of it was the resource typing, so it\nstreamlines the requesting of equipment, particularly among\ndifferent jurisdictions and agencies. If I ask for a particular type\nof vehicle with certain equipment and with the right number of\npeople, then I only need to make one request and I’ll get all of\nthat. If there is something else, I ask for a different type of\nequipment. So the typing is going to help us tremendously\nunder resource management. It also requires that we do\ninventories. Inventories let us know what equipment we have\non hand. We compare that to what we think we’re going to need\nbased on our planning and our exercising, we identified some of\nthe gaps, and then we start looking for ways of filling those\nshortfalls. Mutual aid is one of those activities under resource\nmanagement that is important in helping us use resources across\nlevels, among different agencies, helps the taxpayers, helps the\nresponders, helps the whole Nation.\"\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-41"

ICS is one of the four NIMS\nstructures. Before we explore ICS, let's briefly look at all four NIMS structures.\n“NIMS is a system to provide a framework for all of the team to work together towards common\ngoals.” Craig Fugate, former FEMA Administrator (and past Director, FL Division of\nEmergency Management).\nWhat is NIMS Command and Coordination?\nThere are three major components of the NIMS framework:\n• Resource Management\n• Command and Coordination\n• Communications and Information Management\nTogether these NIMS components provide a framework for effective management during\nincident response.\nYou have already explored Resource Management and the 14 NIMS Management\nCharacteristics. Next, we’ll cover the NIMS structures that enable incident managers to manage\nand coordinate incident response in a unified, consistent manner.\nThe four NIMS Structures are: the Incident Command System, Emergency Operations Centers,\nthe Multi-Agency Coordination Group, and the Joint Information System. Together, these four\nelements comprise the NIMS Command and Coordination structures.\nMultiagency Coordination Systems, or MACS, is an overarching term for the four NIMS\nCommand and Coordination systems: ICS, EOCs, MAC Group and JIS.\nThe Incident Command System, or ICS, is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazard incident\nmanagement concept. ICS allows its users to adopt an integrated organizational structure to\nmatch the complexities and demands of incidents.\nAs an incident becomes more complex, multiagency coordination and the need for additional\nresources becomes increasingly important. Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) support on-\nscene incident command from off-site through multiagency coordination and resources.\nMAC Groups are high level multiagency coordination bodies that support ICS and EOCs\nthrough policy and scarce resource allocation.\nThe final Command and Coordination element is the Joint Information System (JIS). The Joint\nInformation System ensures coordinated and accurate public messaging among the ICS, EOCs\nand MAC Group.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-86"

We use the media to get our message out. The citizens of our jurisdiction\nexpect information from us. They want to know what we’re doing, want to know why we are\ndoing things, and more important they want to know what they should be doing. We also found\nout that if the media isn’t kept in the loop, they are going to go out and start finding stories\nthemselves, finding out information themselves, that means then that we are losing control of the\nmessage. The message is being developed by the individual reporters in the media and that’s\ngoing to start confusing our citizens and get the wrong message to them. We need a coordinated\neffort for public information for the safety of the public and the security of the public and that’s\nwhat public information allows us to do.\nRon Britton, Former NIMS Coordinator, FEMA, Region 10\nPublic information is for public safety.

It can also be used to establish\ninformation exchanged with the local public to know evacuation routes, where the hospitals they\nshould go to—any number of things that would be of safety interest to the public. One of the\nreasons it was developed was to provide a consistent message so that different people in different\nparts of the organization aren’t reporting just what they are seeing, but that there is a centralized\nsystem that allows that information to be one-stop shopping and one message that goes out to the\npublic to keep everyone informed, and that’s all very, very safety related, and I think that’s a real\nkey point.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-143"

In New Orleans, most of the city was flooded. The\ncombined effects of wind, rain, storm surge, breached levees, and flooding knocked out virtually\nthe entire infrastructure—electrical power, roads, water supply and sewage, and communications\nsystems.\n[Thomas Stone, Fire Chief, St. Bernard Parish: “We lost our communications system, and when\nyou are not able to communicate, you can’t coordinate your response. You never think that you\nwill lose your entire infrastructure.”]\nCommunications problems are not limited to systems being destroyed or not functioning. Similar\nproblems arise when agencies cannot exchange needed information because of incompatible\nsystems. NIMS identifies several important features of public safety communications and\ninformation systems.\nCommunications systems need to be . . .\nInteroperable—able to communicate within and across agencies and jurisdictions.\nReliable—able to function in the context of any kind of emergency.\nScalable—suitable for use on a small or large scale as the needs of the incident dictate.\nPortable—built on standardized radio technologies, protocols, and frequencies.\nResilient—able to perform despite damaged or lost infrastructure.\nRedundant—able to use alternate communications methods when primary systems go\nout.\nSecure—able to protect sensitive or classified information from those without a need to\nknow.\nRegardless of the communications hardware being used, standardized procedures, protocols, and\nformats are necessary to gather, collate, synthesize, and disseminate incident information. And in\na crisis, life-and-death decisions depend on the information we receive.\nLesson 7: Communications and Information Management SM-154"

If\nyou can’t talk to each other, you are not going to be able to\nwork together. So, part of the interoperability is making sure\nthat our equipment is compatible. We can talk.

Video\nTranscript - What is NIMS?\nEach day communities respond to numerous emergencies. Most often, these incidents are\nmanaged effectively at the local level. However, there are some incidents that may require a\ncollaborative approach includes personnel from:\n• Multiple jurisdictions\n• A combination of specialties or disciplines\n• Several levels of government\n• Nongovernmental organizations\n• The private sector\nThe National Incident Management System, or NIMS, provides the foundation needed to ensure\nthat we can work together when our communities and the Nation need us the most.\nNIMS integrates best practices into a comprehensive, standardized framework that is flexible\nenough to be applicable across the full spectrum of potential incidents, regardless of cause, size,\nlocation, or complexity.\nUsing NIMS allows us to work together to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and\nmitigate the effects of incidents.\nThis course introduces you to the NIMS concepts, principles, and components.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-14\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 3: NIMS Overview\nWHAT? The National Incident Management System\n(NIMS) defines the comprehensive approach guiding…\nWHO? …the whole community - solutions that serve\nthe entire community are implemented while\nsimultaneously making sure that the resources the\ndifferent members of the community bring to the table\nare leveraged across all levels of government,\nnongovernmental organizations (NGO), and private\nsector organizations to work together seamlessly\nWHY? …to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond\nto, and recover from the effects of incidents.\nWHEN? NIMS applies to all incidents, regardless of\ncause, size, location, or complexity, from planned\nevents to traffic accidents and to major disasters.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-15\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 4: Voices of Experience: NIMS Benefits\nVoices of Experience: NIMS Benefits\nSteve Grainer, Former Chief, Incident Management Programs, VA Dept. of Fire Programs\nNIMS is a national initiative to standardize the fundamental processes that are necessary for\neffectively managing significant emergencies, and it’s applicable in all size and scale and scope\nemergencies.\nHaving been involved at the local, State, and Federal level in a number of different venues\nduring my career, I’m truly and honestly pleased to say that this is an opportunity for us all to\nbetter establish a baseline of competencies for not only emergencies, obviously that would be the\nprimary focus, but also to utilize a nationally vetted process that will work given A) participation\nand B) commitment. So I’m all for the idea of establishing a national systems approach as is\npretty much formatted through the concepts of NIMS in their entirety. It’s a good thing, that’s\nabout the best I can say.\nCurry Mayer, Former Training & Exercise Chief, Governor’s Office of Emergency\nServices (CA)\nNIMS is the national structure that includes roles and responsibilities for responding to an\nincident that would require the Federal Government to be involved, a catastrophic or large-scale\nincident. It’s also a system that provides common terminology, roles, and responsibilities so that\neveryone in the country can basically plug into the national system of response.\nKristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-16\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nNIMS has helped us be better structured, have less duplication, be more organized and more\nefficient and it covers the whole gambit of organization, communications, preparedness, it’s the\nwhole, it’s everything.\nRoberta Runge, National NIMS Coordinator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nNIMS is a system that allows us to plan and prepare and execute a response more effectively\nwith our response partners.\nThe biggest benefit to us as an agency is to be able to understand how our response partners are\nalso going to be executing the response. EPA is a fairly large organization but we hardly ever\nrespond to something very large and very complicated without other Federal and State and local\npartners. If everyone is operating the response using different terminology or a different\nmanagement structure, it becomes very difficult, very fast.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-17\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 5: NIMS Applicability and Scope\nNIMS is a common framework for emergency management and\nincident response that is applicable to all stakeholders with\nincident related responsibilities.\nThe audience for NIMS includes:\n• Emergency responders\n• Other incident personnel\n• Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) such as faith-\nbased and community-based groups\n• The private sector\n• Elected and appointed officials\n• People with disabilities or access and functional needs\nThe scope of NIMS includes:\n• All incidents, regardless of size, complexity, or scope\n• Planned events such as sporting events\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-18\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 6: Overview of NIMS\nThe National Incident Management System (NIMS) defines the comprehensive approach guiding\nthe whole community - all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and the\nprivate sector - to work together seamlessly to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and\nrecover from the effects of incidents.\nNIMS Is NIMS Is Not\n• A comprehensive, nationwide, systematic • Only the Incident Command System\napproach to incident management, including\n• Only applicable to certain\nthe command and coordination of incidents,\nemergency/incident response personnel\nresource management, and information\nmanagement • A static system\n• A set of concepts and principles for all • A response plan\nthreats, hazards, and events across all\nmission areas (Prevention, Protection,\nMitigation, Response, Recovery)\n• Scalable, flexible, and adaptable; used for • Used only during large-scale incidents\nall incidents, from day-to-day to large-scale\n• Standard resource management procedures • A resource ordering system\nthat enable coordination among different\njurisdictions or organizations\n• Essential principles for communications and • A communications plan\ninformation management\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-19\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 7: Discussion Question\nWhat are some common features of NIMS?\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-20\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 8: NIMS Guiding Principles\nIncident management is the application of resources by\norganizations to plan for, respond to, and recover from an\nincident.\nPriorities for incident management in planning, response, and\nrecovery efforts include saving lives, stabilizing the incident,\nand protecting property and the environment.\nTo achieve these priorities, incident management personnel\nuse NIMS components in accordance with three NIMS\nguiding principles:\n• Flexibility\n• Standardization\n• Unity of Effort\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-21\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 9: Flexibility\nThe NIMS guiding principle of flexibility\nallows NIMS to be scalable from routine, local\nincidents through those requiring interstate\nmutual aid up to those requiring Federal\nassistance.\nFlexibility enables NIMS to be applicable to\nincidents that vary widely in terms of hazard,\ngeography, demographics, climate, cultural,\nand organizational authorities.\nNIMS components are adaptable to any type of\nevent or incident.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-22\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 10: Standardization\nThe NIMS guiding principle of standardization supports\ninteroperability among multiple organizations in incident\nresponse.\nNIMS defines standard organizational structures that\nimprove integration and connectivity among\norganizations.\nNIMS defines standard practices that allow incident\npersonnel and organizations to work together effectively.\nNIMS includes common terminology, which enables\neffective communication.\nLesson 1: Fundamentals and Concepts of NIMS SM-23\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 11: Unity of Effort\nThe NIMS guiding principle of Unity of Effort means\ncoordinating activities among various organizational\nrepresentatives to achieve common objectives.

The major Components of\nNIMS provide a common framework to\nintegrate these diverse capabilities and achieve\ncommon goals.\n• Resource Management\n• Command and Coordination\n• Communications and Information\nManagement\nThe application of all three components is vital\nto successful NIMS implementation.\nFollowing is a synopsis of each major component of NIMS:\n• Resource Management. Resources (such as personnel, equipment,\nand/or supplies) are needed to support critical incident objectives.\nNote The flow of resources must be fluid and adaptable to the requirements\nof the incident. NIMS defines standardized mechanisms and\nestablishes the resource management process to: identify\nrequirements for, order and acquire, mobilize, track and report,\nrecover and demobilize, reimburse for, and inventory resources.\n• Command and Coordination. The Command and Management\ncomponent within NIMS is designed to enable effective and efficient\nincident management and coordination by providing flexible,\nstandardized incident management structures. The structure is based\non three key organizational constructs: the Incident Command\nSystem, Multiagency Coordination Systems, and Public Information.\n• Communications and Information Management. Emergency\nmanagement and incident response activities rely on communications\nand information systems that provide a common operating picture to\nall command and coordination sites. NIMS describes the\nrequirements necessary for a standardized framework for\ncommunications and emphasizes the need for a common operating\npicture.

Resource readiness\nand credentialing are maintained through periodic training and exercises.\nWhen an incident occurs, standardized procedures are used to:\n• Identify resource requirements,\n• Order and acquire resources, and\n• Mobilize resources.\nThe purpose of tracking and reporting is accountability. Resource accountability helps ensure\nresponder safety and effective use of incident resources. As incident objectives are reached,\nresources may no longer be necessary. At this point, the demobilization process begins.\nDemobilization is the orderly, safe, and efficient return of an incident resource to its original\nlocation and status. Finally, reimbursement and restocking activities ensure that resource\nproviders are paid for their expenses and resources that have been depleted are replenished.\nWhen disaster strikes, we must be able to take full advantage of all available and qualified\nresources. In this lesson you will learn how NIMS provides the mechanisms for ensuring that we\ncan be inclusive and integrate resources from all levels of government, the private sector, and\nnongovernmental organizations.\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-32\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 3: Resource Management Key Activities\nOverview\nResource management preparedness involves four key activities:\n• Identifying and typing resources\n• Qualifying, certifying, and credentialing personnel\n• Planning for resources\n• Acquiring, storing, and inventorying resources\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-33\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 4: Typing Resources\nResource typing defines and categorizes incident resources\nby capability.\nResource typing establishes common definitions for\ncapabilities of personnel, equipment, teams, supplies, and\nfacilities.\nTyping definitions include the following information:\nCapability: the resource's capability to perform its function\nin one or more of the five mission areas: Prevention,\nProtection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery.\nCategory: the function for which a resource would be most\nuseful (e.g., firefighting, law enforcement, health and\nmedical).\nKind: a broad characterization, such as personnel,\nequipment, teams, and facilities.\nType: a resource's level of capability to perform its function\nbased on size, power, capacity (for equipment), or\nexperience and qualifications; Type 1 has greater capacity\nthan Type 2, 3, or 4.\nThe current FEMA Resource Management and Mutual Aid\nlink contains information on NIMS Resource Typing and\nCredentialing: http://www.fema.gov/resource-\nmanagement-mutual-aid\nThe NIMS Resource Typing Library Tool, also available at\nthe link above, is an online catalog of all NIMS resource\ntyping definitions and job titles/position qualifications that\nhave been released by FEMA.\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-34\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 5: Discussion Question\nWhat are the benefits of typing resources?\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-35\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 6: Qualifying, Certifying and Credentialing\nPersonnel\nThe Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) has the authority and responsibility for qualification,\ncertification, and credentialing within its organization or jurisdiction.\nThe establishment of national standards provide common, compatible structures for the\nqualification and certification of emergency management personnel.\nQualification, certification, and credentialing are the essential steps to help ensure that personnel\ndeploying under mutual aid agreements can perform their assigned roles.\n• Qualifying: Personnel meet the minimum established standards (including training,\nexperience, physical and medical fitness) to fill specific positions.\n• Certification: recognition from an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) or a third party\nthat an individual has completed qualification for a position (one example of a third party\nis an accredited body such as a state licensure board for medical professionals).\n• Credentialing: documentation – typically an identification card or badge – that\nidentifies personnel and verifies their qualifications for a particular position.\nNIMS Overview of Supporting Tools and Aids: www.fema.gov/nims-doctrine-supporting-\nguides-tools\nNIMS Guidelines for Credentialing Personnel are in PDF at:\nhttp://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/nims_cred_guidelines_report.pdf\nAuthority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)\nDefinition: An entity that has the authority and responsibility for developing,\nimplementing, maintaining, and overseeing the qualification process within\nits organization or jurisdiction.

We know each\njurisdiction is going to have to have some resources available\nbut they’re never going to have enough, there is always going\nto be shortfalls, and part of resource management is to manage\nthose gaps in the availability of the resources. So, resource\nmanagement under NIMS gives us a structure and a process to\nbe able to do that. Part of it was the resource typing, so it\nstreamlines the requesting of equipment, particularly among\ndifferent jurisdictions and agencies. If I ask for a particular type\nof vehicle with certain equipment and with the right number of\npeople, then I only need to make one request and I’ll get all of\nthat. If there is something else, I ask for a different type of\nequipment. So the typing is going to help us tremendously\nunder resource management. It also requires that we do\ninventories. Inventories let us know what equipment we have\non hand. We compare that to what we think we’re going to need\nbased on our planning and our exercising, we identified some of\nthe gaps, and then we start looking for ways of filling those\nshortfalls. Mutual aid is one of those activities under resource\nmanagement that is important in helping us use resources across\nlevels, among different agencies, helps the taxpayers, helps the\nresponders, helps the whole Nation.\"\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-41\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 12: Voices of Experience:\nResource Management Words of Advice\nRon Britton, Former NIMS Coordinator, FEMA, Region 10\n\"Resource management is much bigger than just identifying and\nmoving vehicles or planes or so forth, that really, really involves\nthe entire credentialing process of knowing all of our personnel\nresources capabilities and training background and so forth, that\nall needs to be done in a prior preparation event, so that we\nreally know that when those folks arrive on scene, they’re\ncapable of doing the job we’re asking them to do. So it starts\nwith those folks, their credentialing, their qualifications, and then\nas well knowing the types of equipment that we would need to\nhave on scene. So the equipment and the things that need to be\nthere, and that would go under the communications as well\nbecause resource typing would involve the radios, the satellite\nphones, and all of the kinds of support communications that we\nwould need for something to respond.

One of the problems with mutual aid\nin the past has been a common terminology, a common\nnomenclature, speaking the same language. One term to one\nparticular level of government doesn’t necessarily mean the\nsame thing to another, and NIMS addresses those particular\ntypes of issues. We all try to speak in a common language, plain\nEnglish. The other real benefit that NIMS can bring is resource\ntyping. We all know that when you need something that is not\nreadily available within your jurisdiction, you need it fast. It\nspeeds up the process when a person that has an asset can\nunderstand very quickly what you are asking for, and if those\nresources are typed, the benefit to one of the NIMS requirements\nis that a person requesting something and asks for it knows what\nthey are going to get when they follow a typing scheme.\"\nLesson 2: NIMS Resource Management SM-58\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 28: Mutual Aid Agreements and Compacts\nMutual aid agreements establish the legal basis for two or more entities to share resources.\nVarious forms of mutual aid agreements and compacts exist among and between all levels of\ngovernment in the United States.\nThese agreements may authorize mutual aid:\n• Between two or more neighboring communities\n• Among all jurisdictions within an state\n• Between States, Territories and Tribal Governments\n• Between Federal agencies\n• Internationally\n• Between government and NGOs and/or the private sector\n• Among NGOs and/or private sector entities\nMutual Aid Agreements and Compacts (Continued)\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)\nEMAC is a congressionally ratified mutual aid compact that defines a non-\nNote Federal, state-to-state system for sharing resources across state lines during\nan emergency or disaster.

EEI ensures incident\npersonnel gather the most accurate and appropriate data,\ntranslate it into useful information, and communicate it with\nappropriate personnel.\nThe collection, analysis, and sharing of incident-related information are\nimportant activities for all incidents. Typically, staff in the Planning Section\nare responsible for gathering and analyzing operational information and\nsharing situational awareness, and staff in the Operations Section are\nresponsible for executing tactical activities. However, some incidents involve\nintensive intelligence gathering and investigative activity, and for such\nincidents, the Incident Commander or Unified Command may opt to\nreconfigure intelligence/investigations responsibilities to meet the needs of\nthe incident. This may occur when the incident involves a criminal or\nterrorist act and/or other non-law-enforcement intelligence/investigations\nInstructor\nefforts such as epidemiological investigations.\nNote\nFor additional information see the following website:\nhttps://www.fema.gov/nims-doctrine-supporting-guides-tools.\nIn NIMS, “intelligence” refers exclusively to threat-related information\ndeveloped by law enforcement, medical surveillance, and other investigative\norganizations.\nNote\nLesson 3: NIMS Management Characteristics SM-80\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 17: Activity 2.1: NIMS Management\nCharacteristics\nInstructions:",

ICS is one of the four NIMS\nstructures. Before we explore ICS, let's briefly look at all four NIMS structures.\n“NIMS is a system to provide a framework for all of the team to work together towards common\ngoals.” Craig Fugate, former FEMA Administrator (and past Director, FL Division of\nEmergency Management).\nWhat is NIMS Command and Coordination?\nThere are three major components of the NIMS framework:\n• Resource Management\n• Command and Coordination\n• Communications and Information Management\nTogether these NIMS components provide a framework for effective management during\nincident response.\nYou have already explored Resource Management and the 14 NIMS Management\nCharacteristics. Next, we’ll cover the NIMS structures that enable incident managers to manage\nand coordinate incident response in a unified, consistent manner.\nThe four NIMS Structures are: the Incident Command System, Emergency Operations Centers,\nthe Multi-Agency Coordination Group, and the Joint Information System. Together, these four\nelements comprise the NIMS Command and Coordination structures.\nMultiagency Coordination Systems, or MACS, is an overarching term for the four NIMS\nCommand and Coordination systems: ICS, EOCs, MAC Group and JIS.\nThe Incident Command System, or ICS, is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazard incident\nmanagement concept. ICS allows its users to adopt an integrated organizational structure to\nmatch the complexities and demands of incidents.\nAs an incident becomes more complex, multiagency coordination and the need for additional\nresources becomes increasingly important. Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) support on-\nscene incident command from off-site through multiagency coordination and resources.\nMAC Groups are high level multiagency coordination bodies that support ICS and EOCs\nthrough policy and scarce resource allocation.\nThe final Command and Coordination element is the Joint Information System (JIS). The Joint\nInformation System ensures coordinated and accurate public messaging among the ICS, EOCs\nand MAC Group.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-86\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nNIMS is summed up by former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate: [“. . .when we fail to work as\na team, we fail our citizens … NIMS is a system to provide a framework for all of the team to\nwork together towards common goals.”]\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-87\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 3: NIMS Command and Coordination\nStructures\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-88\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 4: NIMS Command and Coordination\nStructures (Continued)\nNIMS structures enable incident managers to manage incidents in a unified, consistent manner.\nWhen an incident occurs or threatens, local emergency personnel manage response using ICS.\nIf the incident is large or complex, off-site EOCs activate to support on-scene operations.\nThe incident personnel in the field and in EOCs receive policy guidance from MAC Groups.\nA Joint Information Center manages the Joint Information System (JIS) to ensure coordinated\nand accurate public messaging among all levels: ICS, EOC and MAC Group.\nThe first NIMS structure we will examine is ICS.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-89\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 5: Voices of Experience: Incident Command\nSystem\n\"ICS is a system to allow responders to be able to organize and respond to an incident.

In large-scale incidents or where\nmultiple command posts are established, the Public Information Officer\nshould participate in or lead the Joint Information Center in order to ensure\nconsistency in the provision of information to the public.\nSafety Officer\nThe Safety Officer monitors incident operations and advises the Incident\nCommander/Unified Command on all matters relating to operational safety,\nincluding the health and safety of emergency responder personnel. The\nNote\nultimate responsibility for the safe conduct of incident management\noperations rests with the Incident Commander/Unified Command and\nsupervisors at all levels of incident management. The Safety Officer is, in\nturn, responsible to the Incident Commander/Unified Command for the\nsystems and procedures necessary to ensure ongoing assessment of\nhazardous environments, including the incident Safety Plan, coordination of\nmultiagency safety efforts, and implementation of measures to promote\nemergency responder safety, as well as the general safety of incident\noperations. The Safety Officer has immediate authority to stop and/or prevent\nunsafe acts during incident operations. It is important to note that the\nagencies, organizations, or jurisdictions that contribute to joint safety\nmanagement efforts do not lose their individual identities or responsibility\nfor their own programs, policies, and personnel. Rather, each contributes to\nthe overall effort to protect all responder personnel involved in incident\noperations.\nLiaison Officer\nThe Liaison Officer is Incident Command’s point of contact for\nrepresentatives of other governmental agencies, nongovernmental\norganizations, and the private sector (with no jurisdiction or legal authority)\nNote\nto provide input on their agency’s policies, resource availability, and other\nincident-related matters. Under either a single Incident Commander or a\nUnified Command structure, representatives from assisting or cooperating\nagencies and organizations coordinate through the Liaison Officer. Agency\nand organizational representatives assigned to an incident must have the\nauthority to speak for their parent agencies or organizations on all matters,\nfollowing appropriate consultations with their agency leadership. Assistants\nand personnel from other agencies or organizations (public or private)\ninvolved in incident management activities may be assigned to the Liaison\nOfficer to facilitate coordination.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-99\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 14: General Staff Overview\nThe General Staff is a group of incident management personnel organized\naccording to function.\nThe ICS General Staff consists of 4 Sections:\nNote • Operations\n• Planning\n• Logistics\n• Finance/Administration\nEach ICS General Staff Section is led by a Section Chief who reports directly\nto the Incident Commander or Unified Command.\nThese individuals are responsible for managing tasks within their functional\narea.\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command activates these section chiefs\nas needed.\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command is responsible to perform\neach General Staff function until a section chief is assigned to manage that\nfunction.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-100\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 15: General Staff Sections\nGeneral Staff Sections\nOperations Section\nThe Operations Section plans and performs tactical activities to achieve the\nNote incident objectives established by the IC/UC.\nIncident objectives typically focus on:\n• Saving lives\n• Reducing the immediate hazard\n• Protecting property and the environment\n• Establishing situational control\n• Restoring normal operations\nPlanning Section\nPlanning Section personnel collect, evaluate, and disseminate incident\ninformation to the Incident Commander/Unified Command and other\nincident personnel.\nPlanning Section staff:\n• Prepare status reports\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-101\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\n• Display situation information\n• Maintain the status of assigned resources\n• Facilitate the incident action planning process\n• Prepare the Incident Action Plan (IAP) based on input from the\nGeneral Staff, Command Staff and Incident Commander/Unified\nCommand guidance.\nLogistics Section\nLogistics Section personnel are responsible for providing services and\nsupport for the incident.\nLogistics Section staff provide:\n• Facilities Security (of the incident command facilities and personnel)\n• Transportation\n• Supplies\n• Equipment maintenance and fuel\n• Food services\n• Communications and information technology support\n• Medical services for incident personnel\nFinance/Administration Section\nThe Incident Commander/Unified Command establishes a\nFinance/Administration Section when the incident management activities\nrequire on-scene or incident-specific finance and administrative support\nservices.\nFinance/Administration Section Staff:\n• Record personnel time\n• Negotiate leases\n• Maintain vendor contracts\n• Administer claims\n• Track and analyze incident costs\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-102\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 16: Common Types of ICS Facilities\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command\ndetermines the kinds and locations of ICS\nfacilities based on what is required to\nsupport the incident.\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command\nmay establish several different kinds of\nfacilities in and around the incident area.\nCommon Types of ICS Facilities (Continued)\nCommon ICS facilities:\n• The Incident Command Post (ICP) -

Examples\ninclude two or more hazardous materials spills, fires, etc. Often these\nkinds of incidents will vie for the same resources.\nNote\n• When an incident expands to a large geographic area, the agency\nofficials may choose to divide the incident into smaller pieces, called\nzones, each of which will be managed by an Incident Management\nTeam (IMT).\n• When incidents are of different kinds and/or do not have similar\nresource demands, they will usually be handled as separate incidents\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-107\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nor will be coordinated through an Emergency Operations Center\n(EOC).\nThe use of an Area Command makes the jobs of Incident Commanders and\nagency officials easier for the following reasons:\n• Much of the cross-incident coordination typically performed by each\nIncident Commander is accomplished at the Area Command level.\nUsing an Area Command allows the Incident Commanders and their\nIMTs to focus attention on their incident objectives, strategies, and\ntactics.\n• Area Command sets priorities between incidents and ensures efficient\nresource use. Critical resources are allocated by the overall priorities\nestablished by the agency officials. Competition among incidents for\ncritical resources is avoided. Often, agency dispatchers will recognize\ncross-incident coordination problems first.\n• Area Command ensures that agency policies, priorities, constraints,\nand guidance are being made known to the Incident Commanders and\nimplemented consistently across incidents.\n• Area Command also reduces the workload of Executives/Senior\nOfficials, especially if there are multiple incidents going on at the\nsame time.\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-108\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 21: Discussion Question\nWhat are some examples when Area Commands have been established?\nLesson 4: Incident Command System (ICS) SM-109\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 22: Discussion Question\nWhat are the commonalities between Area Command and Unified Command?

So different agencies that, it might be that you have, you know, transportation and\nfood and agriculture that are involved in the event so what are, what those public, the public\ninformation message, although one coordinated message needs to include the elements from\nthose different agencies that are involved, and who are the stakeholders, who are the people that\nhave been impacted, and ensuring that your message is coordinated so that everyone that needs\nto have some kind of information about the event gets what they need from that. The new thing\nfor NIMS is that each level of government and each agency involved has a public information\nresponsibility, but they come together and have one, one message that comes out.\nBill Campbell, Former Director of Training, NY State Emergency Management Office\nPublic information is number one, it’s one of the command staff positions within the ICS\nstructures so that tells you right up front that in the incident command system we place a lot of\nemphasis on public information and information in general. I think the importance and\nsignificance of public information is higher and greater now than it’s ever been in our history.\nYou’ve got to have a coordinated way to get a consistent message out. We’ve got to be very\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-142\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nclear and concise in our message to the public as to what we want them to do. Public information\nis more than just the public, it’s also the response community too.\nDaryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, Brazos River Authority, TX\nWe need to have a single point of contact for the media so that we can get our information out to\nthe general public. We use the media to get our message out. The citizens of our jurisdiction\nexpect information from us. They want to know what we’re doing, want to know why we are\ndoing things, and more important they want to know what they should be doing. We also found\nout that if the media isn’t kept in the loop, they are going to go out and start finding stories\nthemselves, finding out information themselves, that means then that we are losing control of the\nmessage. The message is being developed by the individual reporters in the media and that’s\ngoing to start confusing our citizens and get the wrong message to them. We need a coordinated\neffort for public information for the safety of the public and the security of the public and that’s\nwhat public information allows us to do.\nRon Britton, Former NIMS Coordinator, FEMA, Region 10\nPublic information is for public safety. We really want that information for people in the\nenvirons as well as people who are part of the response community to know what the situation is.\nThey need to know that to stay safe and to perform best. It can also be used to establish\ninformation exchanged with the local public to know evacuation routes, where the hospitals they\nshould go to—any number of things that would be of safety interest to the public. One of the\nreasons it was developed was to provide a consistent message so that different people in different\nparts of the organization aren’t reporting just what they are seeing, but that there is a centralized\nsystem that allows that information to be one-stop shopping and one message that goes out to the\npublic to keep everyone informed, and that’s all very, very safety related, and I think that’s a real\nkey point.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-143\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 14: Discussion Question\nWhy is it important that the JIS operates across and support the other NIMS Command and\nCoordination structures?\nWho would you include in your Joint Information System?\nWhat are the supporting elements of the JIS?\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-144\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 15: Interconnectivity of NIMS Command and\nCoordination Structures\nNIMS structures enable incident managers to\nmanage incidents in a unified, consistent\nmanner.\nInterconnectivity of NIMS structures is\nimportant to allow personnel in diverse\ngeographic areas, with differing roles and\nresponsibilities, and operating within various\nfunctions of ICS and/or EOCs to integrate their\nefforts through common organizational\nstructures, terminology, and processes.\nIf required resources are not available locally, they can be obtained under\nmutual aid agreements from neighboring jurisdictions, or State, tribal,\nterritorial, and interstate sources and assigned to the control of the Incident\nNote\nCommander or Unified Command.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-145\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 16: Interconnectivity of NIMS Command and\nCoordination Structures (Continued)\n• When an incident occurs or threatens,\nlocal emergency personnel manage\nresponse using NIMS principles and\nICS.\n• If the incident is or becomes large or\ncomplex, local EOCs activate.\n• EOCs receive senior level guidance\nfrom MAC Groups.\n• A Joint Information Center (JIC)\nmanages the Joint Information System\n(JIS) operations to ensure coordinated\nand accurate public messaging among\nall levels: ICS, EOC and MAC Group.\nNIMS structures enable incident\nmanagers to manage incidents in a\nunified, consistent manner.\nLesson 6: Other NIMS Structures and Interconnectivity SM-146\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 17: Federal Support to Response Activities\nThe Federal Government has a variety of capabilities and resources to support domestic\nincidents.\nMost incidents are resolved using capabilities available from the local jurisdiction.\nLarger incidents are resolved with support from by neighboring jurisdictions, or State, tribal,\nterritorial, and interstate sources.\nThe Federal Government only becomes involved with a response:\n• When state governors or tribal leaders request Federal assistance and their requests are\napproved\n• When Federal interests are involved\n• As statute or regulation authorizes or requires\nIn most cases the Federal Government plays a supporting role to state, tribal, or territorial\ngovernments by providing Federal assistance to the affected jurisdictions.\nFor example, the Federal Government provides assistance under the Robert T.

In New Orleans, most of the city was flooded. The\ncombined effects of wind, rain, storm surge, breached levees, and flooding knocked out virtually\nthe entire infrastructure—electrical power, roads, water supply and sewage, and communications\nsystems.\n[Thomas Stone, Fire Chief, St. Bernard Parish: “We lost our communications system, and when\nyou are not able to communicate, you can’t coordinate your response. You never think that you\nwill lose your entire infrastructure.”]\nCommunications problems are not limited to systems being destroyed or not functioning. Similar\nproblems arise when agencies cannot exchange needed information because of incompatible\nsystems. NIMS identifies several important features of public safety communications and\ninformation systems.\nCommunications systems need to be . . .\nInteroperable—able to communicate within and across agencies and jurisdictions.\nReliable—able to function in the context of any kind of emergency.\nScalable—suitable for use on a small or large scale as the needs of the incident dictate.\nPortable—built on standardized radio technologies, protocols, and frequencies.\nResilient—able to perform despite damaged or lost infrastructure.\nRedundant—able to use alternate communications methods when primary systems go\nout.\nSecure—able to protect sensitive or classified information from those without a need to\nknow.\nRegardless of the communications hardware being used, standardized procedures, protocols, and\nformats are necessary to gather, collate, synthesize, and disseminate incident information. And in\na crisis, life-and-death decisions depend on the information we receive.\nLesson 7: Communications and Information Management SM-154\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National

update incident information\ncontinually.\nEffective incident management relies on flexible communications and information systems that\nprovide accurate, timely, and relevant information.\nDuring an incident, this integrated approach:\n• Links all incident personnel, whether on-scene, in an EOC, or in another support location\n• Maintains communications connectivity and situational awareness\nFour key communications and information systems principles support the ability of incident\nmanagers to maintain this constant flow of information during an incident:\n• Interoperability\n•

If\nyou can’t talk to each other, you are not going to be able to\nwork together. So, part of the interoperability is making sure\nthat our equipment is compatible. We can talk. The second part\nof equipment compatibility is that the equipment works\ntogether. You can’t take a fire truck that has a 6-inch hose and\ntry to put it to a fire hydrant that operates with a 4-inch\nconnector. So if I take my truck from my facility and I bring it\nout to help you, if I can’t get the water pumped in, if I can’t\nhook our systems together, we’re not going to be able to work\nin a coordinated effort. Second thing is interoperability between\npeople and organizations. Part of that is the verbal\ncommunications where I say something, use a particular term,\nand it means the same thing to you. If the terms that I use mean\ndifferent things to different people, we’re going to have a hard\ntime communicating and doing what needs to be done to\naccomplish our mission. So, it’s a little bit of both. The\nequipment, the people, and then how do people work together\nwithin the organization to accomplish those objectives and get\nthe mission done.\"\nLesson 7: Communications and Information Management SM-179\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 27: Lesson 7: Communications and\nInformation Management Summary\nThe lesson presented an overview of Communications and Information Management.\nThe lesson specifically discussed the:\n• Key Principles of Communications and Information management\n• Communications and Information Management Characteristics\n• Elements of Incident Information\n• Communication Standards and Format\nThe next lesson will provide a summary of the information introduced in this course along with\nadditional resources.\nLesson 7: Communications and Information Management SM-180\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nLesson 8: Course Summary\nLesson 8: Course Summary SM-181\n\n\nJune 2020 IS-0700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System\nVisual 1: Lesson 8: Course Summary\nCongratulations!
