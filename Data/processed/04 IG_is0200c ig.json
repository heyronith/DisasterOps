Property damage ran into the millions, and\nmany people died or were injured. The personnel assigned to determine the\ncauses of these outcomes studied the case histories and discovered that\nresponse problems could rarely be attributed to lack of resources or failure of\ntactics. Surprisingly, studies found that response problems were far more\nlikely to result from inadequate management than from any other single\nreason.\nICS:\n• Is a standardized management tool for meeting the demands of small\nInstructor\nor large emergency or nonemergency situations.\nNote\n• Represents “best practices” and has become the standard for\nemergency management across the country.\n• May be used for planned events, natural disasters, and acts of\nterrorism.\n• Is a key feature of the National Incident Management System\n(NIMS).\nICS is not just a standardized organizational chart, but an entire management\nsystem.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-33\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Why ICS?\nAll levels of government, the private sector, and\nnongovernmental agencies must be prepared to prevent, protect\nagainst, mitigate, respond to, and recover from a wide spectrum\nof major events and natural disasters that exceed the capabilities\nof any single entity. Threats from natural disasters and human-\ncaused events, such as terrorism, require a unified and\ncoordinated national approach to planning and to domestic\nincident management.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-34\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Homeland Security Presidential Directives\nHSPD-5, Management of Domestic Incidents, identified steps for\nimproved coordination in response to incidents. It required the Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS) to coordinate with other Federal departments\nand agencies and State, local, and tribal governments to establish a National\nResponse Framework (NRF) and a National Incident Management System\n(NIMS).\nHSPD-8, National Preparedness, directed DHS to lead a national initiative\nto develop a National Preparedness System—a common, unified approach to\n“strengthen the preparedness of the United States to prevent and respond to\nthreatened or actual domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other\nemergencies.”\nPresidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8), National Preparedness,\ndescribes the Nation's approach to preparedness-one that involves the whole\ncommunity, including individuals, businesses, community- and faith-based\norganizations, schools, tribes, and all levels of government (Federal, State,\nlocal, tribal and territorial).\nHSPD-5, HSPD-8, and PPD-8\nCopies of the HSPD-5, Management of Domestic Incidents, HSPD-8,\nNational Preparedness, and Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8), National\nPreparedness can be found online.

Actions to implement the use of NIMS take place at\ntwo levels - policy and organizational/operational.\nAt the policy level, implementing NIMS means government officials, i.e.,\ngovernors, mayors, county and city managers, tribal leaders, and others:\n• Adopt the NIMS through executive order, proclamation, or legislation\nas the jurisdiction's official incident response system; and\n• Direct that incident managers and response organizations in their\njurisdictions train, exercise, and use the NIMS in their response\noperations.\nAt the organizational/operational level, evidence that incident managers and\nemergency response organizations are implementing NIMS would include\nthe following:\n• NIMS is being integrated into functional and system-wide emergency\noperations policies, plans, and procedures.\n• NIMS training is planned or under way for responders, supervisors,\nand command level officers; and\n• Incident personnel at all levels are participating and/or coordinating\nexercises involving NIMS structures and responders from multiple\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-36\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\ndisciplines and jurisdictions.\nThe NIMS doctrine can be found at: www.fema.gov/national-incident-\nmanagement-system\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-37\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Major Components of NIMS\nJurisdictions and organizations involved in the management\nof incidents vary in their authorities, management\nstructures, communication capabilities and protocols, and\nmany other factors.\nThe major components of NIMS provide a common\nframework to integrate these diverse capabilities and\nachieve common goals.\nThe application of all three components is vital to\nsuccessful NIMS implementation.\nResource Management\nResource Management describes standard mechanisms to systematically\nmanage resources, including personnel, equipment, supplies, teams, and\nfacilities, both before and during incidents in order to allow organizations to\nNote\nmore effectively share resources when needed.\nCommand and Coordination\nCommand and Coordination describes leadership roles, processes, and\nrecommended organizational structures for incident management at the\noperational and incident support levels and explains how these structures\nNote\ninteract to manage incidents effectively and efficiently.\nCommunications and Information Management\nCommunications and Information Management describes systems and\nmethods that help to ensure that incident personnel and other decision makers\nhave the means and information they need to make and communicate\nNote\ndecisions.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-38\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nNIMS Management Characteristics\nThe following video will introduce the NIMS Management Characteristics\ndiscussed in detail in this unit.\nVideo Duration: 2 minutes, 30 seconds\nVideo\nNIMS Management Characteristics: Overview\nVideo Transcript\nAs you learned in the previous lesson, ICS is based on proven NIMS management principles,\nwhich contribute to the strength and efficiency of the overall system.\nICS incorporates a wide range of management features and principles, beginning with the use of\ncommon terminology.\n[David Burns, Emergency Preparedness Manager, University of California Los Angeles]\nCommunication is probably one of the most essential elements of ICS. It’s important that we\nknow how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River Authority] If the\nterms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to have a hard time\ncommunicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our mission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an\nIncident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your end\nobjective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So you can\nestablish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan, and you can ensure\nthat they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established under a\nsingle Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management Office]\nOne of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the same\nframework.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-39\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nICS helps ensure full utilization of all incident resources by:\n• Maintaining a manageable span of control\n• Establishing designated incident facilities and locations\n• Implementing comprehensive resource management practices\n• Defining clear processes for dispatch/ deployment of resources\n• Ensuring integrated communications\nICS supports responders and decision makers through effective information and intelligence\nmanagement.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] The common operating\npicture is a critical thing that the Coast Guard has been working hard on recently for ourselves\nbecause it’s something that helps us maintain a better operational picture and it’s more consistent\nacross the board, everyone up and down the chain of command and across to other agencies\nunderstand the same picture.\nICS counts on each of us taking personal accountability for our own actions. And finally, the\nmobilization process helps ensure that incident objectives can be achieved while responders\nremain safe.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] To have NIMS work\neffectively, it’s got to be top-down support.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics covered in this lesson form the basis for effective, team-\nbased incident response under the Incident Command System (ICS).\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-40\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 17: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nThis course builds on what you learned in ICS 100 about NIMS Management Characteristics.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics are listed below.\n• Integrated Communications\n• Common Terminology\n• Establishment and Transfer of\n• Modular Organization\nCommand\n• Management by Objectives\n• Unified Command\n• Incident Action Planning\n• Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Manageable Span of Control\nCommand\n• Incident Facilities and Locations\n• Accountability\n• Comprehensive Resource Management\n• Dispatch/Deployment\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-41\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nActivity 1.1\nActivity Purpose: To see how much you remember from ICS-100 about NIMS Management\nCharacteristics.\nTime: 35 minutes\nInstructions:\n• Divide into table teams.\n• Instructions:\nYour team will have 3 minutes to try to list as many NIMS Management\no\nCharacteristics as you can remember.

Refer students to\npages following the activity or National Incident Management\nSystem (NIMS), current edition, for descriptions of each\nManagement Characteristic.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-43\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristics - Supplemental\nMaterials\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Common Terminology\nNIMS establishes common terminology that allows different organizations to work together in a\nwide variety of emergency functions and hazard scenarios.\nCommon terminology helps by reducing confusion and enhancing interoperability.\nThis common terminology covers:\n• Organizational Functions: Major functions and units are named and defined using\nstandardized terms\n• Resource Descriptions: Resources (personnel, equipment, teams and facilities) have\ncommon naming based on their type and capabilities\n• Incident Facilities: Facilities in an incident area are designated using common terms\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Modular Organization\nOrganizational structures for incident management (ICS and EOCs) are modular, meaning that\nthey are each building blocks that are put in place as needed based on an incident’s size,\ncomplexity and hazards.\nThe ICS Commander and EOC director are responsible for the establishment and expansion of\nthe modular organization based on the specific requirements for their incident.\nAs incident complexity increases, the organizational structure expands and management\nresponsibilities are further divided.\nThe number of management, supervisory, and support positions expand as needed to meet the\nneeds of the incident.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Management by Objectives\nIn an incident, all activities are directed to accomplish defined objectives. This is called\nManagement by Objectives.\nUnder ICS the Incident Commander (or Unified Command) establishes incident objectives.\nManagement by objectives includes:\n• Establishing specific, measurable objectives\n• Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks, and activities to achieve the objectives\n• Developing and issuing assignments, plans, procedures and protocols to accomplish tasks\n• Documenting results against objectives to measure performance, facilitate corrective\nactions, and inform development of objectives for the next operational period\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-44\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Action Planning\nIncident action planning guides incident management activities.\nAction Plans:\n• Record and communicate incident objectives, tactics, and assignments for operations and\nsupport\n• Are recommended for all incidents\n• Are not always written, but a written IAP is increasingly important when an incident or\nactivation:\nIs likely to extend beyond one operational period\no\nBecomes more complex\no\nInvolves multiple jurisdictions or agencies\no\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Manageable Span of Control\nSpan of control refers to the number of subordinates that directly report to a supervisor.\nMaintaining an appropriate span of control ensures effective incident management by enabling\nsupervisors to:\n• Direct and supervise subordinates\n• Communicate with and manage resources\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, the 1:5 ratio is only a guideline and effective incident management often calls for\ndifferent ratios.\nWhen a supervisor’s span of control becomes unmanageable, they can assign subordinate\nsupervisors or redistribute subordinates to manage portions of the organization in order to regain\na manageable span of control.\nSpan of control can change based on:\n• Type of incident\n• Nature of the task\n• Existing hazards and safety factors\n• Distances between personnel and resources\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Facilities and Locations\nThe Incident Commander, Unified Command or EOC director establishes incident support\nfacilities for specific purposes.\nThese facilities are identified and located based on the requirements of the situation.\nIncident size and complexity will influence the designation of facilities and locations.\nTypical designated facilities include:\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-45\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\n• Incident Command Post (ICP)\n• Incident base\n• Staging Areas\n• Camps\n• Mass casualty triage areas\n• Points-of-distribution\n• Emergency shelters\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Comprehensive Resource\nManagement\nMaintaining accurate and up-to-date inventories of resources is an essential component of\nincident management.\nResources include personnel, equipment, teams, supplies, and facilities available or potentially\navailable for assignment or allocation.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Integrated Communications\nIntegrated communications allow units from diverse agencies to connect, share information and\nachieve situational awareness.\nIncident managers facilitate communications through the development and use of:\n• A common communications plan\n• Interoperable communications processes and systems\n• Systems that include both voice and data links\nIntegrated Communications Planning occurs both before and during an incident to provide\nequipment, systems, and protocols needed to achieve integrated voice and data communications.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand\nWhen an incident is anticipated or occurs the organization with primary responsibility for the\nincident establishes command by designating the Incident Commander (IC) or Unified\nCommand (UC). Command may need to be transferred to a different IC/UC one or more times\nover the course of a long duration or increasingly complex incident.\nThe current command determines the protocol for transferring command. This transfer process\nshould always include a briefing for the incoming IC/UC on all essential information for\ncontinuing safe and effective operations. The transfer of command should also be communicated\nto all incident personnel.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-46\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Unified Command\nIn some incidents the Incident Command function is performed by a Unified Command (UC).\nUC is typically used for incidents involving:\n• Multiple jurisdictions\n• A single jurisdiction with multiagency involvement\n• Multiple jurisdictions with multiagency involvement\nUC allows agencies with different authorities and responsibilities to work together effectively\nwithout affecting individual agency authority, responsibility, or accountability.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Chain of Command and Unity\nof Command\nChain of command refers to the orderly command hierarchy within an incident management\norganization.\nUnity of command means that each individual reports to only one designated supervisor.\nThese principles:\n• Clarify reporting relationships\n• Eliminate confusion caused by conflicting instructions\n• Enable incident managers at all levels to direct the actions of all personnel under their\nsupervision\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Accountability\nAccountability for all resources during an incident is essential.\nIncident management personnel should adhere to principles of accountability, including:\n• Check-in/checkout\n• Incident action planning\n• Unity of command\n• Personal responsibility\n• Span of control\n• Resource tracking\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Dispatch/Deployment\nResources should deploy only when requested and dispatched through established procedures by\nappropriate authorities.\nResources that authorities do not request should not deploy spontaneously - unrequested\nresources can overburden the IC/UC and increase accountability challenges.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-47\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nIncident-related information and intelligence is managed by the incident management\norganization through established processes for:\n• Gathering\n• Analyzing\n• Assessing\n• Sharing\n• Managing\nInformation and intelligence management includes identifying essential elements of information\n(EEI). EEI ensures incident personnel gather the most accurate and appropriate data, translate it\ninto useful information, and communicate it with appropriate personnel.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-48\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 19: Additional Resources\nFor more information, consult the following resources:\nVisit this website to review the National Incident Management System (NIMS) -\nhttps://www.fema.gov/national-incident-management-system\n• Visit this website to review HSPD-5 in its entirety -\nhttps://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/assets/hspd-5.pdf\nVisit this website to review PPD-8 in its entirety - https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-\ndirective-8-national-preparedness\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-49\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 20: Lesson Summary\nYou have completed the Course Overview lesson.

Discussion questions focus on how to distinguish between “unity of\ncommand” and “Unified Command.”\nNext, formal and informal communication within ICS is described.\nThe unit then transitions to leadership concepts in incident management. Visuals are used to\npresent the common ICS leadership responsibilities and leadership values such as duty, respect,\nand integrity.\nNext, the unit presents communication responsibilities and required briefing elements. Following\na definition of incident management assessment, students identify the types of questions that they\nwould ask to assess the effectiveness of incident management.\nThe next section covers the use of common terminology and the ICS organization. A series of\nquestions is used to review the Command and General Staff positions and sections. Next the\nlesson emphasizes the importance of manageable span of control as an ICS leadership tool and\nnotes that ICS modular organization concepts ensure that an optimal manageable span of control\nis maintained. The last topic covers the standard titles used for ICS supervisory positions.\nFor the flexible delivery version of the course, there are there activities included. The purpose of\nActivity 2.1 is for the students to practice recognizing potential incident management\nissues. They are given a scenario and asked to identify potential management issues. The\npurpose of Activity 2.2 is to allow students to practice identifying communication strategies to\navoid problems during incident operations. Students are provided a scenario and will list\nstrategies on chart paper and report out to the group. Activity 2.3 is designed to stimulate\nthought and discussion about desirable leadership qualities. Students must identify important\nleadership qualities and how they relate to incident response.\nKnowledge checks are strategically embedded throughout the lessons in the online version of the\ncourse so students may assess their level of retained and recalled learning of the instructional\ncontent.\nTime Plan\nA suggested time plan for this unit is shown below. More or less time may be required, based on\nthe experience level of the group.\nTopic Time\nUnit 2: Incident Command and Unified 50 minutes\nCommand\nActivity 2.1: Unified Command 15 minutes\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-53\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nTopic Time\nActivity 2.2: Incident Communications 15 minutes\nActivity 2.3: Incident Leadership 20 minutes\nTotal Time 1 hour 40 minutes\nIndependent Study: 45 minutes\nMaterials\n• PowerPoint visuals 2.1 – 2.40\n• Student Manual\nReference\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS) Doctrine.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-54\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 1: Unit Objectives\nAt the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n• Describe chain of command and formal communication relationships.\n• Identify common leadership responsibilities and values.\n• Describe span of control and modular development.\n• Describe the use of position titles.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-55\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 2: Chain of Command\nAn orderly line of authority is used for the flow of task assignments and resource requests.\nThis line of authority flows down through the organizational structure.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-56\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Unity of Command\nUnity of command means that each individual involved in\nincident operations will be assigned – and will report – to only\none supervisor.\nChain of command and unity of command help to ensure that\nclear reporting relationships exist and eliminate the confusion\ncaused by multiple, conflicting directives. Incident managers at\nall levels must be able to control the actions of all personnel\nunder their supervision.\nUnity of command clears up many of the potential\ncommunication problems encountered in managing incidents or\nevents because each individual maintains a formal\ncommunication relationship only with his or her immediate\nsupervisor.\nDon't confuse unity of command with Unified Command!\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-57\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Unified Command (1 of 2)\nWhen no one jurisdiction, agency, or\norganization has primary authority and/or the\nresources to manage an incident on its own,\nUnified Command may be established. There is\nno one \"Commander.\" The Unified Command\ncan allocate resources regardless of ownership or\nlocation.\nThis illustration shows three responsible\nagencies managing an incident together under a\nUnified Command.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-58\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Unified Command (2 of 2)\nUnified Command:\n• Enables all responsible agencies to manage\nan incident together by establishing a\ncommon set of incident objectives and\nstrategies\n• Allows Incident Commanders to make joint\ndecisions by establishing a single command\nstructure at one Incident Command Post\n(ICP)\n• Maintains Unity of Command.

Continue the discussion until all teams’ identified strategies have\nbeen presented.\nShare with the students the actual actions taken in this scenario:\nArlington County Fire Department Captain Jeff Liebold used foot\nmessengers to inventory onsite units. He sent two firefighters on foot to\nrecord the identification number and location of each piece of equipment on\nthe Pentagon grounds because radio communications could not be employed\nto perform this task. Foot messengers often proved to be the most reliable\nmeans of communications during the initial rescue efforts. Fortunately, a\nsurplus of personnel was available at the incident site to serve in that\ncapacity. According to the Arlington County After-Action Report, fire and\nrescue organizations should establish plans for alternate means of\ncommunications during mass-casualty incidents. A number of methods can\nbe employed, including foot messengers.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-68\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Discussion Question\nWhy is leadership an essential element of successful incident/event management?\nAsk the participants:\nWhy is leadership an essential element of successful incident/event\nmanagement?\nAdd any examples that you think will help illustrate the teaching point.\nInstructor\nNote\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-69\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 14: Common Leadership Responsibilities\nA good leader:\n• Communicates by giving specific instructions and\nasking for feedback.\n• Supervises the scene of action.\n• Evaluates the effectiveness of the plan.\n• Understands and accepts the need to modify plans or\ninstructions.\n• Ensures safe work practices.\n• Takes command of assigned resources.\n• Motivates with a \"can do safely\" attitude.\n• Demonstrates initiative by taking action.\nThe safety of all personnel involved in an incident or a planned event is the\nfirst duty of ICS leadership. This is the overall responsibility of Team\nLeaders, Group or Division Supervisors, Branch Directors, Sections Chiefs,\nand all members of the Command or Unified Command staff. Ensuring safe\nNote\nwork practices is the top priority within the ICS common leadership\nresponsibilities.\nPresent the following key points\nNote the following additional key points about decisionmaking:\n• Demonstrating initiative requires the ability to make sound, timely\ndecisions during an incident or event.\n• Effective decisionmaking can avert tragedy and help the community\nrecover from the event more quickly.\n• Conversely, poor decisionmaking or the absence of decisions potentially\nInstructor\ncan result in injury or death to victims or responders. But the repercussions\nNote\ndon’t stop there. Poor decisions in the early stages of an incident can make\nthe responders’ job more difficult and more dangerous. In addition, they can\ngive rise to much more critical or complex decisions.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-70\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Leadership & Values\nA leader commits to excellence in all aspects of his or her\nprofessional responsibility.

The IC has overall\nNote\nauthority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is\nresponsible for the management of all incident operations at the\nincident site.\n• Command Staff: The Command Staff consists of:\nLiaison Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible\no\nfor coordinating with representatives from cooperating and\nassisting agencies. The Liaison Officer may have Assistants.\nPublic Information Officer: A member of the Command Staff\no\nresponsible for interfacing with the public and media or with\nother agencies with incident-related information requirements.\nSafety Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible for\no\nmonitoring and assessing safety hazards or unsafe situations, and\nfor developing measures for ensuring personnel safety. The Safety\nOfficer may have Assistants.\n• General Staff: The organization level having functional\nresponsibility for primary segments of incident management\n(Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance/Administration). The\nSection level is organizationally between Branch and Incident\nCommander. Sections are as follows:\nOperations Section: The Operations Section responsible for all\no\ntactical operations at the incident. The Operations Section\nincludes:\n Branch: That organizational level having functional,\ngeographical, or jurisdictional responsibility for major\nparts of the incident operations. The Branch level is\norganizationally between Section and Division/Group\nin the Operations Section, and between Section and\nUnits in the Logistics Section. Branches are identified\nby the use of Roman numerals, by function, or by\njurisdictional name.\n Division: That organization level having responsibility\nfor operations within a defined geographic area. The\nDivision level is organizationally between the Strike\nTeam and the Branch.\n Group: Groups are established to divide the incident\ninto functional areas of operation. Groups are located\nbetween Branches (when activated) and Resources in\nthe Operations Section.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-87\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\n Unit: That organization element having functional\nresponsibility for a specific incident planning,\nlogistics, or finance activity.\n Task Force: A group of resources with common\ncommunications and a leader that may be\npreestablished and sent to an incident or formed at an\nincident.\n Strike Team/Resource Team: Specified\ncombinations of the same kind and type of resources,\nwith common communications and a leader.\n Single Resource: An individual, a piece of equipment\nand its personnel complement, or an established crew\nor team of individuals with an identified work\nsupervisor, that can be used on an incident.\nPlanning Section: Responsible for the collection, evaluation, and\no\ndissemination of information related to the incident, and for the\npreparation and documentation of the Incident Action Plan.

This Section includes the Situation, Resources,\nDocumentation, and Demobilization Units, as well as Technical\nSpecialists.\nLogistics Section: The Section responsible for providing\no\nfacilities, services, and materials for the incident. Includes the\nService Branch (Communications Unit, Medical Unit, and Food\nUnit) and Support Branch (Supply Unit, Facilities Unit, and\nGround Support Unit).\nFinance/Administration Section: The Section responsible for all\no\nincident costs and financial considerations. The\nFinance/Administration Section includes the Time Unit,\nProcurement Unit, Compensation/Claims Unit, and Cost Unit.\nIntelligence/Investigations (I/I) Function: Some incidents\no\ninvolve intensive intelligence gathering and investigative activity,\nand for such incidents, the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand may reconfigure intelligence and investigations\nresponsibilities to meet the needs of the incident. The purpose of\nthe Intelligence/Investigations function is to ensure that\nintelligence and investigative operations and activities are\nproperly managed and coordinated.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-88\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: NIMS Management: Manageable Span of\nControl\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, effective incident management frequently necessitates ratios significantly different\nfrom this. The 1:5 ratio is a guideline, and incident personnel use their best judgment to\ndetermine the actual distribution of subordinates to supervisors for a given incident or EOC\nactivation.\nSpan of control is key to effective and efficient incident management.\nMaintaining an effective span of control is important because safety and\naccountability are a priority.\nNote\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-89\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Span of Control\nWhat influences span of control?\nAnswer:\nSpan-of-control ratios can be driven by a number of factors such as:\n• Type of incident\n• Nature of the task\n• Hazards and safety factors\n• Experience of the supervisor and subordinates\n• Communication access between the subordinates and the supervisor\nImportant Note: Planning is critical in order to avoid runaway ordering of\nInstructor resources and the loss of an effective span of control.\nNote Provide examples from personal experience of incidents that would use a\nspan of control of three or four subordinates to a supervisor. Ask the\nparticipants for additional examples.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-90\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Modular Organization\nThe ICS organization adheres to a \"form\nfollows function\" philosophy. The size of the\ncurrent organization and that of the next\noperational period is determined through the\nincident planning process.\nBecause the ICS is a modular concept,\nmanaging span of control is accomplished by\norganizing resources into Teams, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections. When the\nsupervisor-to-subordinate ratio exceeds\nmanageable span of control, additional Teams,\nDivisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections can\nbe established. When a supervisor is managing\ntoo few subordinates, Sections, Branches,\nDivisions, Groups, or Teams can be\nreorganized or demobilized to reach a more\neffective span of control.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-91\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Typical Organizational Structure\nThe initial response to most domestic incidents is\ntypically handled by local \"911\" dispatch centers,\nemergency responders within a single jurisdiction, and\ndirect supporters of emergency responders. Most\nresponses need go no further.\nApproximately 95% of all incidents are small\nresponses that include:\n• Command: Incident Commander and other\nCommand Staff\n• Single Resource: An individual, a piece of\nequipment and its personnel complement, or\nan established crew or team of individuals with\nan identified work supervisor that can be used\non an incident\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-92\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Expanding Incidents\nIncidents that begin with single resources may rapidly expand requiring significant additional\nresources and operational support.\nPresent the following key points:\nExpanding incidents may add supervisory layers to the organizational\nstructure as needed.\nInstructor\nNote\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-93\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Use of Position Titles\nAt each level within the ICS organization, individuals\nwith primary responsibility positions have distinct\ntitles.

As such, tribal governments are\nresponsible for coordinating resources to address actual or potential\nincidents. When local resources are not adequate, tribal leaders seek\nassistance from States or the Federal Government.\nFor certain types of Federal assistance, tribal governments work with the\nState, but as sovereign entities they can elect to deal directly with the Federal\nInstructor\nGovernment for other types of assistance. In order to obtain Federal\nNote\nassistance via the Stafford Act, a State Governor must request a Presidential\ndeclaration on behalf of a tribe.\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-130\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: Mutual Aid Agreements and Compacts\n(Continued)\nMutual aid is the voluntary provision of resources by\nagencies or organizations to assist each other when\nexisting resources are inadequate.\nNIMS resource management describes how mutual aid\nallows jurisdictions to share resources among mutual aid\npartners.\nMutual Aid Agreement Topics\nMutual aid agreements might include some of the following topics:\n• Reimbursement: Mutual aid services are either paid or unpaid (e.g.,\nNote based on providing reciprocal services). Some mutual aid agreements\nspecify reimbursement parameters.\n• Recognition of Licensure and Certification: Guidelines to ensure\nrecognition of licensures across geopolitical boundaries.\n• Procedures for Mobilization (Request, Dispatch, and Response):\nSpecific procedures for parties to request and dispatch resources\nthrough mutual aid.\n• Protocols for Voice and Data Interoperability: Protocols that\nspecify how different communications and IT systems share\ninformation.\n• Protocols for Resource Management: Standard templates for\npackaging resources based on NIMS resource typing definitions\nand/or local inventory systems.\nPresent the following key points:\nAt a minimum, mutual aid agreements should include the following elements\nor provisions:\n• Definitions of key terms used in the agreement\n• Roles and responsibilities of individual parties\n• Procedures for requesting and providing assistance\nInstructor\n• Procedures, authorities, and rules for payment, reimbursement, and\nNote\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-131\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nallocation of cost\n• Notification procedures\n• Protocols for interoperable communications\n• Relationships with other agreements among jurisdictions\n• Workers compensation\n• Treatment of liability and immunity\n• Recognition of qualifications and certifications\n• Sharing agreements, as required\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-132\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Mutual Aid and Assistance: All Levels\nMutual aid agreements and assistance agreements are used at all\nlevels of government:\n• Local jurisdictions participate in mutual aid through\nagreements with neighboring jurisdictions.\n• States can participate in mutual aid through the\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC).\n• Federal agencies offer mutual aid to each other and to\nStates, tribes, and territories under the National\nResponse Framework (NRF).\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)\nEMAC is a congressionally ratified mutual aid compact that defines a non-\nFederal, state-to-state system for sharing resources across state lines during\nan emergency or disaster. Signatories include all 50 states, the District of\nNote\nColumbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The PIO gathers,\nverifies, coordinates, and disseminates\naccessible,15 meaningful, and timely\ninformation on the incident for both internal\nand external audiences. The PIO also monitors\nthe media and other sources of public\ninformation to collect relevant information and\ntransmits this information to the appropriate\ncomponents of the incident management\norganization. In incidents that involve PIOs\nfrom different agencies, the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command designates\none as the lead PIO. All PIOs should work in a\nunified manner, speaking with one voice, and\nensure that all messaging is consistent. The\nIncident Commander or Unified Command\napproves the release of incident-related\ninformation. In large-scale incidents, the PIO\nparticipates in or leads the Joint Information\nCenter (JIC).\nSafety Officer The Safety Officer monitors incident\noperations and advises the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command on matters\nrelating to the health and safety of incident\npersonnel. Ultimate responsibility for the safe\nconduct of incident management rests with the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command and\nsupervisors at all levels. The Safety Officer is\nresponsible to the Incident Commander or\nUnified Command for establishing the systems\nand procedures necessary to assess,\ncommunicate, and mitigate hazardous\nenvironments. This includes developing and\nmaintaining the incident Safety Plan,\ncoordinating multiagency safety efforts, and\nimplementing measures to promote the safety\nof incident personnel and incident sites.

In ICS these are called assisting agencies.\nAn assisting agency is defined as an agency or organization\nproviding personnel, services, or other resources to the agency\nwith direct responsibility for incident management.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-153\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Cooperating Agency\nA cooperating agency is an agency supplying assistance other\nthan direct operational or support functions or resources to\nthe incident management effort.\nDon't get confused between an assisting agency and a\ncooperating agency!\nAn assisting agency has direct responsibility for incident\nresponse, whereas a cooperating agency is simply offering\nassistance.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-154\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Agency Representative\nAn Agency Representative is an individual assigned to an\nincident from an assisting or cooperating agency. The Agency\nRepresentative is delegated authority to make decisions on\nmatters affecting that agency's participation at the incident.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-155\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 14: Expanding Incidents\nAn incident may start small and then expand. As the incident\ngrows in scope and the number of resources needed increases,\nthere may be a need to activate Teams, Units, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections to maintain an appropriate span\nof control. The optimal span of control for incident\nmanagement is one supervisor to five subordinates; however,\neffective incident management may require ratios different from\nthis. The 1:5 ratio is just a guideline.\nThe ability to delegate the supervision of resources not only\nfrees up the Incident Commander to perform critical decision-\nmaking and evaluation duties, but also clearly defines the lines\nof communication to everyone involved in the incident.\nNext, we'll review the major organizational elements that may\nbe activated during an expanding incident.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-156\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Operations Section\nThe Operations Section:\n• Directs and coordinates all incident tactical\noperations\n• Is typically one of the first organizations to be\nassigned to the incident\n• Expands from the bottom up\n• Has the most incident resources\n• May have Staging Areas and special\norganizations\nPresent the following key point:\nThe Operations Section is responsible for all activities focused on reducing\nthe immediate hazard, saving lives and property, establishing situational\ncontrol, and restoring normal operations.\nInstructor\nNote\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-157\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: Operations Section Chief\nThe Operations Section Chief:\n• Is responsible to the Incident Commander for\nthe direct management of all incident-related\noperational activities\n• Establishes tactical objectives for each\noperational period\n• Has direct involvement in the preparation of\nthe Incident Action Plan\nThe Operations Section Chief may have one or more\nDeputies assigned. The assignment of Deputies from\nother agencies may be advantageous in the case of\nmultijurisdictional incidents.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-158\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 17: Operations Section: Staging Areas\nStaging Areas are set up at the incident where resources can\nwait for a tactical assignment.\nAll resources in the Staging Area are assigned and ready for\ndeployment. Out-of-service resources are NOT located at the\nStaging Area.\nAfter a Staging Area has been designated and named, a Staging\nArea Manager will be assigned. The Staging Area Manager will\nreport to the Operations Section Chief or to the Incident\nCommander if the Operations Section Chief has not been\ndesignated.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-159\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: Staging Areas: Chain of Command\nThe graphic below shows where the Staging Area Manager fits into the Operations Section.\nPresent the following key points:\nStaging Areas are set up at the incident where resources can wait for a\ntactical assignment.\nAll resources in the Staging Area are assigned and ready for deployment.\nOut-of-service resources are NOT located at the Staging Area.\nAfter a Staging Area has been designated and named, a Staging Area\nManager will be assigned.

Branches are established when the number of divisions or groups exceeds an effective\nspan of control for the Operations Section Chief.\nBranches are identified by Roman numerals or functional name.\nBranches are managed by a Branch Director. Branch Directors may have\nNote deputy positions as required. In multiagency incidents, the use of Deputy\nBranch Directors from assisting agencies can be of great benefit to ensure\nand enhance interagency coordination.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-162\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 21: Activity 4.1: The Expanding Incident\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at maintaining span of control by adjusting the ICS\norganization structure as an expanding scenario incident unfolds.\nTime: 30 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .\n1.

When I/I is required for\nspecialized types of responses, the IC/UC can place the I/I function in multiple locations within\nthe incident command structure based on factors such as the nature of the incident, the level of I/I\nactivity, and the relationship of I/I to other incident activities. The I/I can be placed in the\nPlanning Section, in the Operations Section, within the Command Staff, as a separate General\nStaff section, or in some combination of these locations.\nIntelligence/Investigations Functional Guidance\nThe Intelligence/Investigations Functional Guidance and Field Operations\nGuide, published October 2013, defined Intelligence/ Investigations as a\nseparate function. This function can be established in a variety of different\nways including as a branch under Operations or as a fifth General Staff\nSection within the ICS structure.\nThe Intelligence/Investigations (I/I) Function is responsible for the\nmanagement, coordination, and direction of intelligence and investigation\noperations and activities.\nIncidents can involve multiple hazards and threats requiring multiple\nsimultaneous activities: life safety, evidence and crime scene preservation,\nand investigations of the cause of the incident. Incident Command must\nInstructor manage these sometimes competing priorities.\nNote\nThe I/I Function is flexible. The Incident Commander or Unified Command\ndetermine If the I/I is needed, and where it is best placed within the ICS\nstructure to effectively manage the incident. For many types of incidents I/I\nmay not be required at all. When I/I is implemented it can be established as a\nfifth General Staff Section, as a branch or group under the Operations\nSection, or even as a branch under the Plans Section.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-175\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 33: Discussion Question\nWhen might the I/I function be established as a branch under Operations? As a fifth General\nStaff Section within the ICS structure? As a part of the Command Staff?\nAsk the students:\nWhen might the I/I function be established as a branch under Operations? As\na fifth General Staff Section within the ICS structure? As a part of the\nCommand Staff?\nAcknowledge the participants’ responses. If not mentioned by the\nparticipants, here are some possible examples:\nI/I Branch under the Operations Section when the I/I focus is on the tactical\nexecution of an investigation and the management of the associated\nintelligence. Placing the tactical execution of the investigation as a separate\nbranch under operations can help to ensure that the investigation is\nsynchronized with other lifesaving, hazard reduction and property and\nenvironmental protection activities. For example if there is an incident\nresponse with concurrent lifesaving and investigation activities, it may be\nbeneficial to establish an I/I Branch under Operations.\nI/I Branch under the Planning Section when the I/I function is primarily\nInstructor\nrelated to situational awareness or planning efforts. Placing SA and planning\nNote\nrelated intelligence and investigation activities in an I/I Branch under\nplanning can ensure that these activities are synched with the other activities\nof the Planning Section. For example, If there is an incident that requires\nsensitive or classified information gathering and analysis, and there is not a\nsignificant on the ground tactical investigative effort, it may be beneficial to\nestablish an I/I Branch under Planning.\nThe I/I Function should be established as a General Staff Section when a\ncriminal or terrorist act is involved and the nature and specifics of the\nincident, in addition to legal constraints, could restrict the type and scope of\ninformation that may be readily shared. The establishment of an I/I Section\nallows for this information to be compartmentalized from the greater\nresponse effort. Information pertaining to life safety can be provided to the\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-176\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nincident command while ensuring that other intelligence is protected.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-177\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 34: ICS Tools\nSome important tools you should have available at the incident\ninclude:\n• Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) from the affected\njurisdiction(s)\n• Agency policies and procedures manuals for responding\nagencies\n• Maps of the affected area\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-178\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 35: ICS Forms\nICS Forms provide a method of recording and communicating\nkey incident-specific information in a format that is simple,\nconsistent, and supports interoperability.

In addition to these\nIAP related meetings, there will also be other\nmeetings and briefings within the ICS\norganization to include section-level meetings\nand briefings, situation update briefings, and\ntransfer of command briefings.\nIncident Action Planning Process\nExplain: The leg of the “P” describes the initial stages of an incident, when\npersonnel work to gain awareness of the situation and establish the\norganization for incident management. Incident personnel perform the steps\nin the leg of the “P” only one time. Once they are accomplished, incident\nmanagement shifts into a cycle of planning and operations, informed by\nInstructor\nongoing situational awareness and repeated each operational period.\nNote\nOperational Period Planning Cycle\nInitial Response and Assessment\nNote\nThe responder(s) who is first to arrive at the incident scene conducts the\ninitial assessment and takes whatever immediate response actions are\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-191\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nappropriate and possible. The initial or rapid assessment is essential to\ngaining and maintaining situational awareness. It enables the Incident\nCommander to request additional resources and/or support, develop, and\nimplement initial tactics. Jurisdiction officials might decide to activate an\nEOC based on the initial assessment.\nAgency Administrator Briefing\nThe Agency Administrator Briefing is a presentation to the personnel who\nwill be managing or supporting the incident by the administrator or other\nsenior official of the jurisdiction, agency, or organization affected by the\nincident. This briefing occurs when the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand are assuming duties outside their normal responsibilities or are\nfrom an entity or jurisdictional area that does not possess authority to the\nmanage the incident they are being assigned. In such cases, the briefing\nprovides supporting details to the delegation of authority or other document\nthat the jurisdiction, agency, or organization typically provides to the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nDuring the briefing, the agency administrator or a designee provides\ninformation, guidance, and direction—including priorities and constraints—\nnecessary for the successful management of the incident. The briefing is\nintended to ensure a common understanding between the jurisdiction,\nagency, or organization and the incident personnel regarding such things as\nthe environmental, social, political, economic, and cultural issues relevant to\nthe incident and its location.\nIncident Briefing\nThe incident briefing marks the transition from reactive to proactive incident\nmanagement. The initial responder(s) typically delivers the briefing to the\nincoming Incident Commander or Unified Command. This meeting enables\nthe incoming Incident Commander or Unified Command to initiate planning\nfor the next operational period.\nInitial Unified Command Meeting\nIf a Unified Command is managing the incident, the Initial Unified\nCommand Meeting allows members of the Unified Command to meet in\nprivate to discuss each jurisdiction or organization’s priorities and objectives\nas well as any limitations, concerns, and restrictions. During the Initial\nUnified Command Meeting, members of the Unified Command generally\naccomplish the next step by developing the initial joint incident objectives.\nObjectives Development/Update\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command establishes the incident\nobjectives for the initial operational period. After the initial operational\nperiod, the Incident Commander or Unified Command reviews the incident\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-192\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nobjectives and may validate them, modify them, or develop new objectives.\nIncident objectives are based on incident priorities and other requirements.\nClearly communicated priorities and objectives support unity of effort among\nincident personnel and enable the development of appropriate strategies and\ntactics. When the members of the team clearly understand the intent behind\ntheir instructions, they are better equipped to act decisively and make good\ndecisions.\nStrategy Meeting/Command and General Staff Meeting\nAfter developing or revising the incident objectives, the Incident Commander\nor Unified Command typically meets with the Command and General Staff,\nand sometimes others, to discuss the incident objectives and provide\ndirection. This meeting may be called the Strategy Meeting or the Command\nand General Staff Meeting and is held as needed to determine how best to\nmeet the incident objectives.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting, which is held the first time through the planning\ncycle, is particularly important, because it allows team members to share\ninformation and jointly determine the initial approach to response operations.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting may include the initial Incident Commander and\na representative from the Agency Administrator.\nPreparing for the Tactics Meeting\nOnce the approach to achieving or working toward achieving the incident\nobjectives is determined, the Operations Section Chief and staff prepare for\nthe Tactics Meeting by developing tactics and determining the resources that\nwill be applied during the operational period.\nTactics Meeting\nThe Tactics Meeting is a forum for key players to review the proposed tactics\ndeveloped by the Operations Section staff and to conduct planning for\nresource assignments. The Operations Section Chief leads the Tactics\nMeeting, and key participants include the Logistics Section Chief, Safety\nOfficer, a representative from the Planning Section—typically, the Resources\nUnit Leader—and other technical specialists or team members invited by the\nOperations Section Chief, Logistics Section Chief, or Safety Officer. The\nteam uses ICS Forms 215 and 215A, the Operational Planning Worksheet\nand the Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis, to facilitate and document\ndecisions they make during the meeting.\nPreparing for the Planning Meeting\nFollowing the Tactics Meeting, preparations begin for the Planning Meeting.\nTeam members collaborate between the Tactics Meeting and the Planning\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-193\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nMeeting to identify support needs and assign specific operational resources\nto accomplish the operational plan.\nPlanning Meeting\nThe Planning Meeting serves as a final review and approval of operational\nplans and resource assignments developed during and after the Tactics\nMeeting. Ideally, the Planning Meeting involves no surprises and simply\nserves as a review of a plan that the Command and General Staff have\ncollaboratively developed and agreed upon. At the end of the Planning\nMeeting, Command and General Staff, and any agency officials involved,\nconfirm that they can support the plan.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-194\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Effective Meetings and Briefings\nEffective briefings and meetings are:\n• An essential element to good supervision and incident\nmanagement\n• Intended to pass along vital information required in the\ncompletion of incident response actions\nTypically, these briefings are concise and do not include long\ndiscussions or complex decision-making. Rather, they allow\nincident managers and supervisors to communicate specific\ninformation and expectations for the upcoming work period and\nto answer questions.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-195\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Levels of Briefings\nThere are three types of briefings/meetings used in ICS: staff\nlevel, field level, and section level.\n• Staff-level briefings are delivered to resources\nassigned to nonoperational and support tasks at the\nIncident Command Post or Base.\n• Field-level briefings are delivered to individual\nresources or crews who are assigned to operational\ntasks and/or work at or near the incident site.\n• Section-level briefings are delivered to an entire\nSection and include the Operational Period\nBriefing.\nBriefing Types\nStaff-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to nonoperational and\nNote support tasks that are commonly performed at the Incident Base or Command\nPost. These briefings will be delivered to individual staff members or full\nunits within a section. These briefings occur at the beginning of the\nassignment to the incident and as necessary during the assignment. The\nsupervisor attempts to clarify tasks and scope of the work as well as define\nreporting schedule, subordinate responsibilities and delegated authority, and\nthe supervisor's expectations. The supervisor will also introduce coworkers\nand define actual workspace, sources of work supplies, and work schedule.\nField-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to operational tasks and/or\nwork at or near the incident site. These briefings will be delivered to\nindividual subordinates, full crews, or multiple crews such as Strike Teams\nor Task Forces and will occur at the beginning of an operational shift. The\nlocation will usually be near the work site or just prior to mobilization to the\nfield. The supervisor attempts to focus the subordinates on their specific\ntasks and helps define work area, reporting relationships, and expectations.\nSection-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves the briefing of an entire Section (Operations,\nPlanning, Logistics, or Finance/Administration) and is done by the specific\nSection Chief. These briefings occur at the beginning of the assignment to\nthe incident and after the arrival of Section supervisory staff. The Section\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-196\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nChief may schedule periodic briefings at specific times (once per day) or\nwhen necessary. A unique briefing in this category is the Operational\nPeriod Briefing (also called a Shift Operations Briefing). Here, the\nOperations Section Chief presents the plan for all operational elements for\nthe specific operational period. This specific briefing is done at the beginning\nof each operation shift and prior to the operational resources being deployed\nto the area of work. Often, a field-level briefing will take place subsequent to\nthe completion of the Operational Period Briefing.\nDuring any section-level briefing, the supervisor attempts to share incident-\nwide direction from the Incident Commander (IC), how the direction impacts\nthe Section staff, and specific ways the Section will support the IC's\ndirection. The supervisor will establish Section staffing requirements,\nSection work tasks, Section-wide scheduling rules, and overall timelines for\nmeetings and completion of work products.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-197\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Activity 5.1: Briefing Information\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at determining the appropriate details required when\npreparing for an incident briefing and identifying information pertinent to the audience to\nbe covered in the briefing.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your group:\n1.

Next, the unit reviews the NIMS\nManagement Characteristic of modular organization in an expanding incident. The unit explains\nthat incident complexity determines the types of incident objectives and resource requirements.\nNext, students identify critical factors they would use to determine the complexity of a selected\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-210\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nincident. The purpose of Activity 6.1 is to give students the opportunity to practice identifying\nthe indicators that are considered when analyzing and determining the complexity of an incident.\nThe next sections of the unit present tools for analyzing the complexity of an incident. After\nconsidering the factors affecting incident complexity, the unit introduces the concept of resource\nkinds and types. The final section of the unit covers the incident complexity types. Activity 6.2 at\nthe end of the unit gives students the opportunity to type a series of incidents.\nKnowledge checks are strategically embedded throughout the unit so students may assess their\nlevel of retained and recalled learning of the instructional content.\nTime Plan\nA suggested time plan for this unit is shown below.

The ICS\norganization may be expanded easily from a very small size for\nroutine operations to a larger organization capable of handling\ncatastrophic events.\nStandardization within ICS does NOT limit flexibility. ICS\nworks for small, routine operations as well as catastrophic\nevents.\nFlexibility does NOT mean that the NIMS Management\nCharacteristic Common Terminology is superseded. Flexibility\nis exercised only within the standard ICS organizational\nstructure and position titles. Flexibility does not mean using\nnon-standard organizational structures or position titles that\nwould interfere with the NIMS Management Characteristics\nCommon Terminology and Modular Organization.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-213\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Modular Organization\nIncident command organizational structure is based on:\n• Size and complexity of the incident\n• Specifics of the hazard environment created by\nthe incident\n• Incident planning process and incident\nobjectives\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-214\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Discussion Question\nShould an incident's ICS organizational structure include all General and Command Staff\nfunctions and positions at all times?\nAsk the participants:\nShould an incident's ICS organizational structure include all General and\nCommand Staff functions and positions at all times?

Other\nincidents will require some or all members of the\nCommand Staff and all sub-elements of each General\nStaff section.\nThe decision to activate an element (Section,\nBranch, Division, Group or Unit) must be based on\nincident objectives and resource needs.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-217\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Activation of Organizational Elements\n(Continued)\nAn important concept is that many organizational\nelements may be activated in various Sections without\nactivating the Section Chief.\nFor example, the Situation Unit can be activated without a\nPlanning Section Chief assigned. In this case, the\nsupervision of the Situation Unit will rest with the\nIncident Commander.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-218\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Discussion Question\nShould you combine ICS positions and titles in order to save on staffing or achieve a higher\nlevel of efficiency?\nAsk the participants:\nShould you combine ICS positions in order to save on staffing or achieve a\nhigher level of efficiency?

Rather than combining\npositions, you may assign the same individual to supervise multiple units.\nWhen assigning personnel to multiple positions, do not use nonstandard titles. Creating new\ntitles may be unrecognizable to assisting or cooperating personnel and may cause confusion.\nBe aware of potential span-of-control issues that may arise from assigning one person to\nmultiple positions.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-220\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Resource Management\nMaintaining an accurate and up-to-date picture of\nresource utilization is a critical component of\nincident management. The incident resource\nmanagement process consists of the following:\n• Identifying Requirements\n• Ordering and Acquiring\n• Mobilizing\n• Tracking and Reporting\n• Demobilizing\n• Reimbursing and Restocking\nThis section of the lesson reviews key resource\nmanagement principles.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-221\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Anticipating Incident Resource Needs\nExperience and training will help you to predict\nworkloads and corresponding staffing needs. As the\ngraphic illustrates, an incident may build faster than\nresources can arrive.\nEventually, a sufficient number of resources arrive\nand begin to control the incident. As the incident\ndeclines, resources then exceed incident needs.\nRemember that when resources increase or decrease\nyou will have to reassess your organizational\nstructure and staffing to determine if it is right-sized\nfor the resources that are being managed.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-222\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Predicting Incident Workload\nIncident workload patterns are often predictable throughout\nthe incident life cycle. Several examples are provided below:\n• Operations Section: The workload on Operations is\nimmediate and often massive. On a rapidly escalating\nincident, the Operations Section Chief must\ndetermine appropriate tactics; organize, assign, and\nsupervise resources; and at the same time participate\nin the planning process.\n• Planning Section: The Resources and Situation Units\nwill be very busy in the initial phases of the incident.\nIn the later stages, the workload of the\nDocumentation and Demobilization Units will\nincrease.\n• Logistics Section: The Supply and Communications\nUnits will be very active in the initial and final stages\nof the incident.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-223\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Analyzing Incident Complexity\nIt is important to strike the right balance when determining\nresource needs. Having too few resources can lead to loss of life\nand property, while having too many resources can result in\nunqualified personnel deployed without proper supervision.\nA complexity analysis can help:\n• Identify resource requirements\n• Determine if the existing management structure is\nappropriate\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-224\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 14: Complexity Analysis Factors\n• Community and responder safety\n• Impacts to life, property, and the economy\n• Potential hazardous materials\n• Weather and other environmental influences\n• Likelihood of cascading events\n• Potential crime scene (including terrorism)\n• Political sensitivity, external influences, and media relations\n• Area involved, jurisdictional boundaries\n• Availability of resources\nPresent the following key points:\nAsk the participants to review the following complexity factors (listed on the\nvisual):\n• Community and responder safety\n• Impacts to life, property, and the economy\n• Potential hazardous materials\n• Weather and other environmental influences\n• Likelihood of cascading events\n• Potential crime scene (including terrorism)\n• Political sensitivity, external influences, and media relations\nInstructor\n• Area involved, jurisdictional boundaries\nNote\n• Availability of resources\nAsk the participants if there are additional factors that they would add to this\nlist.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-225\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Activity 6.1: Complexity Analysis\nActivity Purpose: To give the students practice at identifying the indicators that are considered\nwhen analyzing and determining the complexity of an incident.\nTime: 20 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your team:\n1.

Typing is done to ensure\nthat responders get the right personnel and\nequipment.\nICS resources are categorized by Capability,\nCategory, Kind, and Type.\n• Capability: The Core Capability for which a\nresource is most useful.\n• Category: The function for which a\nresource is most useful.\n• Kind: A description of what a resource is\n(personnel, teams, facilities, equipment or\nsupplies).\n• Type: The resource's minimum capability to\nperform its function. The level of capability\nis based on size, power and capacity (for\nequipment), or experience and qualifications\n(for personnel or teams).\nResource Typing Example\nExample:\nAn Ambulance Ground Team is in the Emergency Medical Services\nNote Category. It's Resource Kind is a Team. The definition of a Type 3\nAmbulance Ground Team includes a crew of 2 (an EMT 1 and an\nAmbulance Operator), with Basic Life Support (BLS) Capability, and the\ncapacity to transport 2 non-ambulatory patients.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-231\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: Discussion Question\nWhich is a kind?

What are the implications of having resources\nthat exceed the requirements?\nInstructor\nIf not mentioned in the discussion, add the following key points:\nNote\n• Unqualified resources or inadequate resources jeopardize safety and\nachievement of incident objectives.\n• When overly qualified resources are deployed where they are not\nneeded, then they are not available for deployment elsewhere. In\naddition, incident costs may be higher for resources than is necessary.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-233\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 20: Resource Typing (Continued)\nResource types range from Type I (most capable) to Type IV (least capable), letting you\nreserve the appropriate level of resource for your incident by describing the size, capability,\nand staffing qualifications of a specific resource.\nRESOURCE KINDS AND TYPES\n• Resource types range from Type I (most capable) to Type IV (least\ncapable), letting you reserve the appropriate level of resource for your\nincident by describing the size, capability, and staffing qualifications\nof a specific resource.\n• Assigning the Type I label to a resource implies that it has a greater\nlevel of capability than a Type II of the same resource (for example,\ndue to its power, size, or capacity), and so on to Type IV.\n• Typing provides managers with additional information to aid the\nselection and best use of resources. In some cases, a resource may\nhave less than or more than four types; in such cases, either additional\ntypes will be identified, or the type will be described as “not\nInstructor\napplicable.” The type assigned to a resource or component is based\nNote\non a minimum level of capability described by the identified metric(s)\nfor that resource.\nTell the participants that NIMS requires the development of a national\nresource typing protocol.\nA sample resource typing example handout is available.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-234\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 21: Resource Typing and NIMS\nResource Management is a key component of NIMS.\nThis effort helps all Federal, State, tribal, and local\njurisdictions locate, request, and track resources to\nassist neighboring jurisdictions when local capability is\noverwhelmed.\nThe Resource Typing Library Tool (RTLT) is an online\ncatalogue of national resource typing definitions,\nposition qualifications and Position Task Books (PTBs)\nprovided by the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency (FEMA).\nFor more information you can access the RTLT at\nhttps://rtlt.preptoolkit.fema.gov.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-235\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 22: Additional Resource Terminology\nThe following terms apply to resources:\n• A Task Force is a combination of mixed\nresources with common communications\noperating under the direct supervision of a Task\nForce Leader.\n• A Strike Team / Resource Team is a set number\nof resources of the same kind and type with\ncommon communications operating under the\ndirect supervision of a Strike Team Leader. A\nStrike Team may also be referred to as a\nResource Team by law enforcement.\n• A Single Resource is an individual, a piece of\nequipment and its personnel complement, or a\ncrew or team of individuals with an identified\nwork supervisor that can be used on an incident.\nA Resource Team is an alternative term for a Strike Team that is used by\nsome Law Enforcement. A Resource Team consists of a set number of Law\nenforcement resources of the same kind and type with an established\nminimum number of personnel.\nInstructor\nNote\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-236\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 23: Discussion Question\nWhich of these is Strike (Resource) Team?

Type 5 incidents are the least complex and Type 1 the most\ncomplex. Incident typing may be used to:\n• Make decisions about resource requirements.\n• Order Incident Management Teams (IMTs). An IMT is made up of\nthe Command and General Staff members in an ICS organization.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-238\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 25: Incident Typing: Overview (Continued)\nThe incident type corresponds to both the number of resources required and the anticipated\nincident duration. The incident types move from Type 5 being the least complex to Type 1\nbeing the most complex. As the number of resources required gets larger and the duration of\nthe incident gets longer, the complexity increases. The vast majority of incidents are in the\nType 3-5 range.\nClocks do not depict length of incident time.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-239\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 26: Type 5 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 5 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: One or two single resources with up to six\npersonnel. Command and General Staff positions (other\nthan the Incident Commander) are not activated.\n• Time Span: Incident is contained within the first\noperational period and often within a few hours after\nresources arrive on scene. No written Incident Action\nPlan is required.\nExamples include a vehicle fire, an injured person, or a police\ntraffic stop.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-240\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: Type 4 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 4 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: Command Staff and General\nStaff functions are activated (only if\nneeded). Several single resources are\nrequired to mitigate the incident.\n• Time Span: Limited to one operational\nperiod in the control phase. No written\nIncident Action Plan is required for non-\nHazMat incidents. A documented\noperational briefing is completed.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-241\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Type 3 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 3 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: When capabilities exceed initial response,\nthe appropriate ICS positions should be added to match\nthe complexity of the incident. Some or all of the\nCommand and General Staff positions may be activated,\nas well as Division or Group Supervisor and/or Unit\nLeader level positions. An Incident Management Team\n(IMT) or incident command organization manages initial\naction incidents with a significant number of resources,\nand an extended response incident until\ncontainment/control is achieved.\n• Time Span: The incident may extend into multiple\noperational periods and a written Incident Action Plan\nmay be required for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-242\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Type 2 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 2 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: Regional and/or national resources are\nrequired to safely and effectively manage the operations.\nMost or all Command and General Staff positions are\nfilled. Operations personnel typically do not exceed 200\nper operational period and the total does not exceed 500.\nThe agency administrator/official is responsible for the\nincident complexity analysis, agency administrator\nbriefings, and written delegation of authority.\n• Time Span: The incident is expected to go into multiple\noperational periods. A written Incident Action Plan is\nrequired for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-243\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Type 1 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 1 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: National resources are required to safely and\neffectively manage the operations. All Command and\nGeneral Staff positions are activated, and Branches need\nto be established. Operations personnel often exceed 500\nper operational period and total personnel will usually\nexceed 1,000. There is a high impact on the local\njurisdiction, requiring additional staff for office\nadministrative and support functions. The incident may\nresult in a disaster declaration.\n• Time Span: The incident is expected to go into multiple\noperational periods. A written Incident Action Plan is\nrequired for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-244\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Incident Management Teams (IMTs)\nIMTs are rostered groups of ICS-qualified personnel consisting\nof an Incident Commander, other incident leadership, and\npersonnel qualified for other key ICS positions. An IMT may be\nused to respond to an incident. IMTs include Command and\nGeneral Staff members. IMT types correspond to incident type\nand include:\n• Type 5: Local Village and Township Level\n• Type 4: City, County, or Fire District Level\n• Type 3: State, Territory, Tribal, or Metropolitan Area\nLevel\n• Type 2: National and State Level\n• Type 1: National and State Level (Type 1 Incident)\nTeam members are certified as having the necessary training\nand experience to fulfill IMT positions.\nINCIDENT COMPLEXITY TYPES\nIMT is made up of the Command and General Staff members in an ICS\norganization. Persons to fill these positions for various types of incidents or\nevents are often predesignated to ensure that they have the necessary training\nand experience to fulfill the roles and responsibilities of the ICS position.\nThe level of training and experience of the IMT members, coupled with the\nidentified formal response requirements and responsibilities of the IMT, are\nfactors in determining the “type,” or level, of IMT.\nBriefly review the following information about IMT types:\n• Type 5: Local Village and Township Level – A “pool” of primarily\nfire officers from several neighboring departments trained to serve in\nCommand and General Staff positions during the first 6-12 hours of a\nmajor or complex incident.\n• Type 4: City, County, or Fire District Level – A designated team of\nInstructor fire, EMS, and possibly law enforcement officers from a larger and\nNote generally more populated area, typically within a single jurisdiction\n(city or county), activated when necessary to manage a major or\ncomplex incident during the first 6-12 hours and possibly transition to\na Type 3 IMT.\n• Type 3: State or Metropolitan Area Level – A standing team of\ntrained personnel from different departments, organizations, agencies,\nand jurisdictions within a State or DHS Urban Area Security\nInitiative (UASI) region, activated to support incident management at\nincidents that extend beyond one operational period. Type 3 IMTs\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-245\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nwill respond throughout the State or large portions of the State,\ndepending upon State-specific laws, policies, and regulations.\n• Type 2: National and State Level – A federally or State-certified\nteam; has less staffing and experience than Type 1 IMTs, and is\ntypically used on smaller scale national or State incidents. Several\ndozen Type 2 IMTs are currently in existence, and operate through\nthe U.S. Forest Service.\n• Type 1: National and State Level – A federally or State-certified\nteam; is the most robust IMT with the most experience; is fully\nequipped and self-contained. Sixteen Type 1 IMTs are now in\nexistence, and operate through the U.S. Forest Service.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-246\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Activity 6.2: Incident Types\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at determining incident types for various scenarios.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team:\n1.

The vehicle stops when it\nruns into an exhibit hall next to the outdoor stage. A\nfew moments later, as the crowd begins to react, the\nlarge truck catches fire.\nSeveral people were injured as the tanker truck\npassed through the crowd and there could be deaths.\nThere is disorder as some attempt to flee and others\ntry to help.\nThe large truck is an active fire that must be\nsuppressed and could spread to nearby structures.\nThere are other potential hazards including a\ndamaged building and utilities (power, water, and\ngas) that could be damaged.\nPublic safety personnel on scene- law enforcement,\nfire, and EMS- respond immediately to the incident.\nBoth the Central City and Liberty County\nEmergency Operations Centers are notified of these\nevents and prepare to send any additional resources\nrequired for the incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-282\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Establish Command\nIt is now approximately 5:15 pm. You are the first\nsupervisor on scene and there is a need to quickly to\nestablish Incident Command.\nLet’s review a few of the NIMS Management\nCharacteristics that apply to determining the best\napproach for the Incident Command function in an\nincident:\n• Establishment and Transfer of Command - the\nfirst on scene need to explicitly establish incident\nor unified command and clearly state and record\nwhen command is transferred.\n• Chain of Command and Unity of Command -\nall responders must be under a single command\nstructure led by a designated Incident\nCommander (IC) or Unified Command (UC).\n• Unified Command - if multiple organizations,\ndisciplines, or jurisdictions are involved in the\nresponse, is a single IC sufficient, or is there a\nneed for a unified command? UC is normally\nused for incidents involving multiple\njurisdictions, a single jurisdiction with\nmultiagency involvement, or multiple\njurisdictions with multiagency involvement.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-283\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Activity 8.1: Establish Command\nActivity Purpose: To apply key concepts regarding establishing command.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .\n1.

Review the scenario on the previous screens.\n2. Consider the following - You are the first supervisor on scene - what\ntype of incident command do you think is needed?\n3. Choose a spokesperson. Be prepared to present your answer to the\nclass in 10 minutes.\nDebrief:\n1. Ask for one team’s spokesperson to volunteer to present their team’s\nanswer and why they took this approach.\n2. Ask another team’s spokesperson if they had something different and\nto provide their team's reasoning.\n3. Continue the discussion until all teams’ answers have been presented.\nShare with the students the possible answer below, if not mentioned:\nThere is not one right answer to this question. The general rule is that the\njurisdiction or organization with primary responsibility for the incident will\nActivity\ndesignate the incident commander. In this scenario this incident occurred\nwithin the jurisdiction of Liberty County. However, at the outset Fire and\nEMS will likely have the largest role. The Fire resources are from Central\nCity and the EMS are from Liberty County. This is an incident that will\ninvolve multiple jurisdictions and agencies. A Unified Command with\nrepresentatives from the various jurisdictions and agencies involved in\nresponse to this incident, to include Fire/EMS, Law Enforcement and Public\nWorks is also a viable approach. If you chose this, remember that in a\nUnified Command, each organization in the Unified Command provides an\nIncident Commander, and this group of Commanders manage the incident\ntogether by establishing a common set of incident objectives.\nFor the purposes of this scenario, because it is an incident centered on\nremoving casualties from the area of the fire and suppressing the fire, a\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-284\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nsingle Incident Commander is sufficient. We will establish Incident\nCommand with a single Incident Commander from the Fire Service. All\nagencies involved in the response will take direction from this Incident\nCommander.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-285\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Establish Command (Continued)\nYou have established incident command under a single\nIncident Commander. This Incident Commander will be from\nthe Central City Fire Department. Other jurisdictions and\nagencies involved in response to this incident will take their\ndirection from this Incident Commander.\nThis conforms to the NIMS Management Characteristic of\nChain of Command and Unity of Command – all responders\nare under a single command structure led by an Incident\nCommander.\nRemember that the Incident Commander will manage the\nincident by establishing a common set of incident objectives\nfor all jurisdictions and agencies involved in this response.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-286\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: So, what is next?\nActing as the Incident Commander and determining your approach to the incident, your initial\nactions should include a Size-Up.\nA size-up is done to develop initial incident objectives. Incident objectives will define what\ntypes of resources are required to respond to the incident. Finally, the resources the Incident\nCommander will manage affect which Command and General Staff positions will be activated\nto assist the IC in management of the incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-287\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: So, what is next? (Continued)\nThe considerations for a size-up outlined in this course include:\n1. Size-up the nature and magnitude of the incident.\n2. Determine the hazards and safety concerns.\n3. Determine Initial Priorities and immediate Resource Requirements.\n4. Determine the location of the Incident Command Post and Staging Area.\n5. Determine the Entrance and Exit Routes for Responders.\nAgain, you will need to first complete your size-up activities to determine the ICS sections that\nyou will need to manage the incident.\nWe will walk through these initial actions that you will take as the first supervisor on scene.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-288\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Size-Up the Nature and Magnitude\nWe will start size-up by looking at the first two\nconsiderations:\n• Size-up the nature and magnitude of the incident\n• Determine the hazards and safety concerns\nNature and magnitude refer to your assessment of what\nkind of incident you face. This can include the type of\nincident and the size and complexity of the event.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-289\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 14: Discussion Question\nWhat is the nature of the incident on the previous screen?\nAsk the participants:\nWhat is the nature of the incident on the previous screen?\nAnswer:\nThe nature of the incident cannot be captured in one simple factor.\nIt is a fire and rescue event, but it will also require medical treatment, traffic\ncontrol, and public works.\nThere is complexity to this incident because it involves a variety of hazards,\nInstructor\nthreats, jurisdictions, and agencies.\nNote\nRemember that as incidents increase in complexity they will require more\nresources and a larger Incident Command organization.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-290\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Incident Typing\nYou should recall from this course that a useful way of characterizing\nincidents is by incident typing.\nIncidents are categorized into 5 types based on complexity. Type 5\nincidents are the least complex and Type 1 incidents are the most complex.\nFactors that impact the determination of incident type include size of the\nICS structure, number of resources employed, and the length of time the\nincident response is anticipated to last.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-291\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: Discussion Question\nReview the following definitions of the Incident Type.\n• TYPE 5 INCIDENT: One or two single response resources with up to 6 response\npersonnel, Incident expected to last only a few hours, no ICS Command and General\nStaff positions activated.\n• TYPE 4 INCIDENT: Several single response resources required, response will be limited\nto one operational period, select ICS Command and General Staff activated only as\nneeded.\n• TYPE 3 INCIDENT: Resource requirements will exceed the initial response resources,\nmay extend into multiple operational periods, some or all ICS Command and General\nStaff are activated.\n• TYPE 2 INCIDENT: Regional or National resources will be required, the incident will\nextend into multiple operational periods, most or all ICS Command and General Staff\npositions are filled.\n• TYPE 1 INCIDENT: National level resources are required, the incident will extend into\nmultiple operational periods, all ICS Command and General Staff positions are utilized,\nand Branches need to be established.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-292\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nIncident Type\nClocks do not depict length of incident time.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-293\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 17: Discussion Question\nWhat incident type is appropriate for the incident in this scenario?\nAsk the participants:\nWhat incident type is appropriate for the incident in this scenario?\nRefer to the scenario, if necessary.\nAnswer:\nThis is currently probably best described as a Type 4 Incident.\nSeveral single resources such as fire trucks, ambulances and law enforcement\nwill be needed for response to the incident.\nAt this point the incident shows a size and complexity indicating that it will\nInstructor\nlikely be resolved within a single operational period. With more resources\nNote\ncomes a need for increased structure to effectively manage the resources. It is\nlikely that some selected, but not all, ICS Command and General Staff\npositions will be activated.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-294\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: Hazards and Safety Concerns\nUnderstanding that this is a Type 4 Incident\nshould already give you a framework to\nunderstand the number of resources you will\nneed, how long the response may take, and the\nneed to establish some ICS Command and\nGeneral Staff for the incident.\nThe next part of the Initial Response Activities\nis to determine the hazards and safety concerns\nin the incident.\nThinking through the hazards and safety\nconcerns is an important exercise for the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nYou must define the problems that you face\nbefore you can determine and prioritize the\nactions that you need to take in response to the\nincident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-295\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 19: Activity 8.2: Hazards and Safety Concerns\nActivity Purpose: To practice identifying hazards and safety concerns.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .\n1.

Ask another team’s spokesperson to add another hazards and\nsafety concern that their group identified.\n3. Continue the discussion until all teams’ answers have been presented.\nShare with the students the possible answers below, if not mentioned:\nThe hazards include:\n• Vehicle fire with a potential to spread to structures.\n• Potential for explosions if the fire encounters fuel or compressed gas\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-296\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\ncylinders.\n• Damaged utilities that could harm incident survivors and responders.\n• Potential structural collapse of the building hit by the tanker truck.\nThe safety concerns include:\n• Harm to survivors or responders from the hazards.\n• Injured people unable to self-evacuate from the immediate area of the\nfire.\n• Uninjured people fleeing the incident scene.\n• Traffic congestion that restricts responder vehicle access to the\nincident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-297\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 20: Determine Initial Priorities & Immediate\nResource Requirements\nNow that you have defined the nature and magnitude of\nthe incident and understand the hazards and safety\nconcerns that you are faced with, you can start\ndetermining priorities and resources.\nLet’s start by reviewing two of the NIMS Management\nCharacteristics that apply to determining priorities:\n• Management by Objectives: Identify response\npriorities and objectives and define the resources\nrequired to achieve the objectives. This is a key\nactivity that must be documented.\n• Incident Action Planning: Incident objectives,\ntactics and assignments for operations and support\nare recorded and communicated through an\nIncident Action Plan (IAP). While this may not\nstart as an extensive written document early in a\nresponse, as incidents increase in size, complexity,\nand length, it is increasingly important to\ndocument incident response activities.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-298\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 21: Activity 8.3: Incident Objectives\nActivity Purpose: To give the students practice at writing \"SMART\" incident objectives for\nvarious hazards and safety concerns.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your team:\n1. Review the Hazards and Safety concerns on the chart in your Student Manual.\n2. Using the chart included in your SM, determine what actions must be taken in response to\nthe incident.

This location allows direct observation of the incident site at the\nExhibit Hall #2 - Blue Exhibit Hall, which has a clear ingress and egress, and\nis upwind of the incident (so any hazards will tend to blow away from the\nICP).\nThe Staging area should also be a parking area upwind of the incident with\neasy ingress and egress. Parking area 1 is chosen as the staging area because\nit is accessible from C street and responders could ingress and egress through\nthe streets connecting to C Street via points 9 and 10, while remaining\nupwind of the incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-309\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nActivity 8.5: Determining Incident Locations - larger\nmap\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-310\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Establish an ICS Structure\nActing as the Incident Commander you have\ncompleted a size-up to include identifying hazards\nand safety issues, setting priorities, determining\nresources, and defining key initial incident\nmanagement locations.\nNow that you understand what you are trying to\naccomplish and what resources you will be managing,\nyou will need to define the ICS structure that will be\nneeded to support management of the incident.\nAt this point in the scenario, the Incident Command\nlikely consists of the Fire Chief working over the\nhood of a command vehicle. Additional resources\nwill be arriving soon and the Incident Commander\nwill need additional staff personnel to help in the\nmanagement in the incident response.\nEstablish an ICS Structure (Continued)\nThere are several NIMS Management Characteristics that can be applied to\ndetermining the appropriate ICS structure for an incident:\nNote • Chain of Command and Unity of Command: All resources should\nwork for a single general staff section and all general staff sections\nshould report to and receive direction from a single IC.\n• Manageable Span of Control: the ICS structure must be of a\nsufficient size to assist the IC in effectively managing the incident. A\nkey to this is constraining the number of subordinates or functions\nthat each supervisor manages.\n• Modular Organization: what pieces of the ICS structure are needed\nto manage the incident? Think ahead to the next operational period\nbecause what you need then often must be asked for now.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-311\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nWhat ICS Command and General Staff positions will you need\nto manage the incident?\nRemember that the Incident Commander/Unified Command is\nresponsible for performing all of these functions personally\nuntil he or she activates that function.\n• Incident Command\n• Public Information\n• Safety\n• Liaison\n• Operations\n• Planning\n• Logistics\n• Finance/Administration\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-312\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nWe previously assessed that this is a Type 4 Incident.\nWe expect several pieces of fire apparatus, ambulance crews, and\nlaw enforcement personnel to be involved. Between the incident site,\nthe staging area, and the perimeter we can assume that at least 30\nLaw Enforcement, Fire, and EMS personnel will be involved in the\nincident response. These personnel will be distributed across at six to\nten separate locations in and around the fairgrounds.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-313\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nFor the purposes of this activity, we will only look at the eight Command Staff and General Staff\npositions.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-314\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nRecall what function each Command and General Staff position performs:\n• Public Information Officer (PIO) interfaces with the public, media, and others needing\nincident information.\n• Safety Officer monitors incident operations and advises the Incident Command on\nmatters relating to health and safety.\n• Liaison Officer serves as the Incident Command’s point of contact for organizations not\nincluded in the Unified Command.\n• Operations Section plans and performs tactical activities to achieve the Incident\nObjectives established by the Incident Command.\n• Planning Section personnel collect, evaluate, and disseminate incident information to the\nIC/UC and other incident personnel.\n• Logistics Section personnel are responsible for providing services and support for the\nincident.\n• IC/UC establishes a Finance/Administration Section when the incident management\nactivities require on-scene or incident-specific finance and administrative support\nservices.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-315\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 33: Activity 8.6: Staff Selection Practice\nActivity Purpose: To allow students an opportunity to analyze the incident and select the\nappropriate staffing.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your team:\n1.

Compare the similarities and differences among the staff\nthey selected.\n4. Summarize the main learning points from this activity.\nIf not mentioned, below are possible answers:\nPublic Information Officer\nYou will probably need to designate a Public Information Officer (PIO) relatively early in the\nincident to interfaces the media and others needing incident information. This incident will\nattract media attention, and there will be public inquiries about incident casualties.\nSafety Officer\nYou may need to designate a Safety Officer to monitors incident operations and advise the\nIncident Commander on health and safety. A Safety officer is a legal requirement for any\nHazMat incident, but is also a good practice for any incident involving multiple hazards.\nLiaison Officer\nThe Liaison Officer serves as the incident command’s point of contact for organizations not\nincluded in the Command. You may have chosen not to activate this position. If you did it is\nlikely because you assess other agencies such as Public Health or Public works will have a role\nin the incident response.\nOperations Officer\nYou should certainly activate the Operations Section to plan and performs tactical activities to\nachieve the incident objectives. The size of this response operation will exceed what you can\nreasonably expect the Incident Commander to manage personally.\nPlanning Section\nYou might not initially assess that you require a Planning Section to collect, evaluate, and\ndisseminate incident information. The current assessment is that the incident will be resolved\nwithin a few hours. However, if you assess that this will extend into a second operational period\nthe establishment of a Plans Section becomes important. It allows Operations to focus on the\ncurrent operational period while Plans looks ahead to the next operational period.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-317\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nLogistics Section\nInitially you may not assess that a separate Logistics Section is needed to manage services and\nsupport for the incident. A staging area manager under the Operations Section may be sufficient\nfor your initial resource management needs. However, as the incident increased in size,\ncomplexity it will take increasing time and resources. When you assess that the incident is\ncontinuing to grow in size and complexity you should establish a Logistics Chief to manage this\ndistinct function.\nFinance/Administration Section\nYou likely did not elect to establish a Finance/Administration Section because at this point the\nincident management activities do not require on-scene or incident-specific finance and\nadministrative support services. Again, when you assess that the incident is continuing to grow in\nsize and complexity you will have to consider establishing a Finance/Administration Section\nChief to manage this function.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-318\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 34: Scenario Part 2\nIt is now just after 6 p.m. and the situation appears to\nbe getting worse.\nThe initial assessment of several injuries was\nincorrect. There are over a dozen injuries and at least\nthree dead.\nThe vehicle fire spread quickly to the building,\nigniting a damaged natural gas line in a kitchen area.\nThe combination of explosion, fire, and collision\ndamage caused the building to partially collapse. The\nfire continues to burn and now threatens other\nsurrounding structures.\nThe crowds are under control, but traffic has not yet\ncompletely cleared from the area and continues to\nslow the ingress and egress of emergency\nmanagement resources.\nThe vehicle driver has not been found and the origin\nand contents of the large truck have not been\nidentified. This raises new concerns that this could\nhave been an intentional act and that the truck could\nhave been transporting something hazardous.\nThis incident has increased in size and complexity\nand will extend into at least one more operational\nperiod.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-319\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 35: Activity 8.7: Expanding Incident\nActivity Purpose: To apply key concepts to analyze incidents.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .\n1. Based on the scenario update, review the factors that your instructor has assigned to you.\n2. Develop answers for each assigned factor.\n3. Choose a spokesperson. Be prepared to present your answers to the class in 10 minutes.\nIncident Command: This is an incident that will now involve more\njurisdictions and agencies. Law Enforcement is concerned with investigation\nand crime scene preservation, and Hazardous Materials (HazMat) assessment\nmust be reconciled with your other priorities. A Unified Command with\nrepresentatives from the various jurisdictions and agencies involved in\nresponse to this incident, to include Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, and Public\nWorks may now be the best approach for Incident Command.\nNature and magnitude of the incident: This is now a Type 3 Incident.\nResource requirements will exceed the initial response resources you have on\nsite, the incident will extend into multiple operational periods, and additional\nICS Command and General Staff positions will have to be activated\nHazards and safety concerns: The number of concerns has increased.\nPriorities and resource requirements: While your current objectives are\nstill valid, there will be additional objectives associated with law\nActivity\nenforcement investigation, HazMat response, and Public Works actions that\nwill require the development of new objectives. These objectives will have to\nbe prioritized and additional resources will be needed to accomplish the\nobjectives.\nICS structure: The ICS structure will need to be expanded. Liaisons, a\nPlanning Section, a Logistics Section, and an Intelligence/Investigations\nfunction are some of the positions that should now be considered for\ninclusion in the Incident Command structure.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-320\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 36: Transfer of Command (Continued)\nThe initial Incident Commander may continue to\nserve as a member of a Unified Command. It is\nalso possible that the increase in complexity will\nlead to the appointment of more senior personnel\nto Incident Command.\nRemember that Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand is a NIMS Management\nCharacteristic. You must clearly state and record\nwhen command is transferred.\nThe Transfer of Command should be conducted\nto create minimal disruption to the incident.\nWhenever possible, the Transfer of Command\nshould include a complete briefing on the\nsituation conducted face to face with the new\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristic Incident\nAction Planning also applies here. Incident\nobjectives, tactics, and assignments for\noperations and support should be recorded and\ncommunicated through an Incident Action Plan\n(IAP). As your incident increased in size,\ncomplexity, and length, you should have started\nto document incident response activities in a\nwritten plan.\nThe ICS Form 201 is a standard format to record\nkey situational information and document\nactions taken on an incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-321\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 37: Lesson Summary\nYou have completed the Application Activity.

After reviewing the summary information, you will receive\ninstructions for taking the course Final Exam.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-326\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 2: Lesson 1: Course Overview (NIMS & ICS\nReview)\n• NIMS provides the Nation with a standardized framework for incident management.\n• ICS, a part of NIMS, is a management system used to meet the demands of incidents\nlarge or small, planned or unplanned.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics:\n• Common Terminology • Integrated Communications\n• Modular Organization • Establishment and Transfer of\n• Management by Objectives Command\n• Incident Action Planning • Unified Command\n• Manageable Span of Control • Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Incident Facilities and Locations Command\n• Comprehensive Resource Management • Accountability\n• Dispatch/Deployment\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-327\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Lesson 2: Incident Command and Unified\nCommand\n• Chain of Command is the line of authority that flows down through the organizational\nstructure.\n• Unity of Command means that each individual will be assigned and report to only one\nsupervisor.\n• Unity of Command is different from Unified Command; Unified Command is established\nwhen no one jurisdiction, agency, or organization has primary authority, therefore there is\nno one clear Incident Commander. These multiple agencies work together to\ncommunicate and make command decisions.\n• Communication during an incident may be formal or informal\nFormal communications must be used for work assignments, resource requests, and\no\nprogress reports.\nInformal communication is used to exchange incident or event information only.\no\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-328\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Lesson 2: Incident Command and Unified\nCommand\n• All levels of leadership on an incident should understand and practice the leadership\nprinciples, have a commitment to duty, and take actions that prioritize the safety of\npersonnel.\n• Clear communication is the responsibility of all responders in order to accomplish\nincident objectives. Incident Management Assessments may be conducted by leadership\nafter an incident to help personnel process what happened and why.\n• ICS utilizes a Modular Organization so that the organization can expand and contract as\nan incident grows and shrinks. This modular organization helps maintain an effective\nspan of control.\n• Manageable span of control with Modular Organization is accomplished by organizing\nresources into Teams, Divisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections. Leadership in each\norganizational level holds a unique title.\n• The flexibility allowed for in ICS does not override the importance of Common\nTerminology. Common Terminology must be used to maintain clear communication,\nwhether formal or informal.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-329\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• Authority is the right or obligation to act on behalf of a department, agency, or\njurisdiction.\n• The scope of authority that an Incident Commander has is determined by existing laws,\npolicies, and procedures. Additional authority may be delegated when necessary.\n• Delegation of authority is the process of granting authority to an individual or agency to\ncarry out specific functions during an incident.\n• Delegation of authority does NOT relieve the granting entity of the responsibility for that\nfunction. Authority can be delegated; responsibility cannot.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-330\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 6: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• When needed, a delegation of authority should contain elements related to restrictions,\nexternal implications and considerations, and planning and communication processes.\n• Authority is implemented by the Incident Commander through the management of\nobjectives. Effective Incident Objectives should be SMART. Objectives are not tactics or\nstrategies; they state what needs to be accomplished, not how to do it.\n• Objectives are a part of the Incident Action Plan, which is completed each operational\nperiod and outlines incident-specific information. It is created through a process known\nas the Operational Period Planning Cycle (Planning P).\n• Incident Command, as well as Command and General Staff, should also have a working\nknowledge of other preparedness plans, such as EOPs, SOGs, SOPs, and mutual aid\nagreements.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-331\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• The Incident Commander oversees the incident, sets incident objectives, and approves the\nIAP.\n• Command Staff include the Public Information Officer, Safety Officer, and Liaison\nOfficer.\n• The Incident Commander also oversees four sections of the ICS organizational structure:\nOperations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance & Administration. Each of these sections is\nresponsible for a different function during an incident; Sections are led by the General\nStaff who report to the Incident Commander. General Staff are titled as Section Chiefs.\n• Operations directs and coordinates all incident tactical operations.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-332\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• Planning maintains resource and situation status, prepares the IAP and other documents,\nand looks beyond the current operational period to anticipate potential future problems or\nevents.\n• Logistics is responsible for all support requirements, including communications, facility\nsupplies, medical needs, and food and drink for incident personnel.\n• Finance/Administration provides administrative and financial support services. This\nincludes handling claims related to property damage, injuries, and fatalities.\n• ICS Forms help communicate and organize information between Command, Command\nStaff, General Staff, and other incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-333\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Lesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Different meetings and briefings are used during the Incident Action Planning Process to\nshare information.\n• Briefings should be concise and may occur at the staff, field, or section level.\n• Information shared during a briefing includes the current situation and objectives, safety\nissues and emergency procedures, work tasks, facilities and work areas, communication\nprotocols, expectations, resource acquisition procedures, work schedules, and questions\nor concerns.\n• The Operational Period Briefing is led by the Incident Commander to present the IAP.\nCommand and General Staff will also participate to share important information.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-334\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Lesson 6: Organizational Flexibility\n• NIMS requires organizational standardization use of Common Terminology; however,\nICS is still flexible due to its Modular Organization.\n• Functions and positions within the organizational structure are activated and filled based\non the needs and demand of an incident. The ICS organizational structure will expand\nand contract with the incident.\n• Personnel may hold multiple titles within an incident's organizational structure, but the\ntitles must keep consistent with NIMS titles. Titles may not be shortened or combined.\n• Proper Resource Management is essential to maintaining an accurate and up-to-date\npicture of resource utilization and needs.\n• Incidents are typed based on size and complexity. Incident types move from Type 5 as\nthe least complex to Type 1 as the most complex.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-335\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Lesson 7: Transfer of Command\n• Transfer of Command is the process of moving the responsibility for incident command\nfrom one Incident Commander to another Incident Commander or Unified Command.\n• Transfer of Command should take place face-to-face when possible and include a\ncomplete briefing that captures essential information.\n• The transfer of command briefing should include elements such as the situation status,\nincident objectives and priorities, current organization, resource information, incident\ncommunications plan, etc.\n• A notification of the time and date that the transfer of command becomes effective should\nbe communicated to all incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-336\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Congratulations!\nYou should now be able to demonstrate knowledge of how to manage an initial response to an\nincident.\nThe course specifically discussed:\n• Incident Command and Unified Command\n• Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives\n• Functional Areas & Positions\n• Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Organizational Flexibility\n• Transfer of Command\n• Application of ICS for Initial Response\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-337\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: IS-200.c Final Exam Instructions\nWhen the review is completed, follow these Final Exam instructions:\n1.

It’s important that we\nknow how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River Authority] If the\nterms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to have a hard time\ncommunicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our mission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an\nIncident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your end\nobjective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So you can\nestablish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan, and you can ensure\nthat they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established under a\nsingle Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management Office]\nOne of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the same\nframework.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-39"

Discussion questions focus on how to distinguish between “unity of\ncommand” and “Unified Command.”\nNext, formal and informal communication within ICS is described.\nThe unit then transitions to leadership concepts in incident management. Visuals are used to\npresent the common ICS leadership responsibilities and leadership values such as duty, respect,\nand integrity.\nNext, the unit presents communication responsibilities and required briefing elements. Following\na definition of incident management assessment, students identify the types of questions that they\nwould ask to assess the effectiveness of incident management.\nThe next section covers the use of common terminology and the ICS organization. A series of\nquestions is used to review the Command and General Staff positions and sections. Next the\nlesson emphasizes the importance of manageable span of control as an ICS leadership tool and\nnotes that ICS modular organization concepts ensure that an optimal manageable span of control\nis maintained. The last topic covers the standard titles used for ICS supervisory positions.\nFor the flexible delivery version of the course, there are there activities included. The purpose of\nActivity 2.1 is for the students to practice recognizing potential incident management\nissues. They are given a scenario and asked to identify potential management issues. The\npurpose of Activity 2.2 is to allow students to practice identifying communication strategies to\navoid problems during incident operations. Students are provided a scenario and will list\nstrategies on chart paper and report out to the group. Activity 2.3 is designed to stimulate\nthought and discussion about desirable leadership qualities. Students must identify important\nleadership qualities and how they relate to incident response.\nKnowledge checks are strategically embedded throughout the lessons in the online version of the\ncourse so students may assess their level of retained and recalled learning of the instructional\ncontent.\nTime Plan\nA suggested time plan for this unit is shown below.

Be prepared to present your findings to the\nclass in 10 minutes.\nScenario:\nA tornado collapsed a building, trapping 15 people in its basement. Fire\ndepartment officers immediately designated a fire station located directly\nacross from the incident site as the Incident Command Post (ICP). However,\nthe fire station’s confined location and immediate proximity to the incident\nmade it ill-suited for directing the large-scale response effort. As police\nofficers arrived on the scene, they decided to establish their Command\nCenter at a school, several blocks away from the immediate response\nactivities.\nActivity\nAs response operations progressed and a mobile command vehicle became\navailable, the Incident Command Post (ICP) was established in that vehicle\njust north of the hospital. Other agencies involved, such as the fire\ndepartment and emergency medical services, began operating near the new\nICP location and Incident Commander. The police department continued to\noperate from the school.\nDebrief Instructions:\n1. Ask for one team’s spokesperson to volunteer to present one of the\nteam’s identified issues.\n2. Ask another team’s spokesperson to add another issue that their group\nidentified.\n3. Continue the discussion until all teams’ identified issues have been\npresented.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-62"

He sent two firefighters on foot to\nrecord the identification number and location of each piece of equipment on\nthe Pentagon grounds because radio communications could not be employed\nto perform this task. Foot messengers often proved to be the most reliable\nmeans of communications during the initial rescue efforts. Fortunately, a\nsurplus of personnel was available at the incident site to serve in that\ncapacity. According to the Arlington County After-Action Report, fire and\nrescue organizations should establish plans for alternate means of\ncommunications during mass-casualty incidents. A number of methods can\nbe employed, including foot messengers.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-68"

The size of the\ncurrent organization and that of the next\noperational period is determined through the\nincident planning process.\nBecause the ICS is a modular concept,\nmanaging span of control is accomplished by\norganizing resources into Teams, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections. When the\nsupervisor-to-subordinate ratio exceeds\nmanageable span of control, additional Teams,\nDivisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections can\nbe established.

Placing the tactical execution of the investigation as a separate\nbranch under operations can help to ensure that the investigation is\nsynchronized with other lifesaving, hazard reduction and property and\nenvironmental protection activities.

The initial or rapid assessment is essential to\ngaining and maintaining situational awareness. It enables the Incident\nCommander to request additional resources and/or support, develop, and\nimplement initial tactics. Jurisdiction officials might decide to activate an\nEOC based on the initial assessment.\nAgency Administrator Briefing\nThe Agency Administrator Briefing is a presentation to the personnel who\nwill be managing or supporting the incident by the administrator or other\nsenior official of the jurisdiction, agency, or organization affected by the\nincident. This briefing occurs when the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand are assuming duties outside their normal responsibilities or are\nfrom an entity or jurisdictional area that does not possess authority to the\nmanage the incident they are being assigned. In such cases, the briefing\nprovides supporting details to the delegation of authority or other document\nthat the jurisdiction, agency, or organization typically provides to the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nDuring the briefing, the agency administrator or a designee provides\ninformation, guidance, and direction—including priorities and constraints—\nnecessary for the successful management of the incident. The briefing is\nintended to ensure a common understanding between the jurisdiction,\nagency, or organization and the incident personnel regarding such things as\nthe environmental, social, political, economic, and cultural issues relevant to\nthe incident and its location.\nIncident Briefing\nThe incident briefing marks the transition from reactive to proactive incident\nmanagement. The initial responder(s) typically delivers the briefing to the\nincoming Incident Commander or Unified Command. This meeting enables\nthe incoming Incident Commander or Unified Command to initiate planning\nfor the next operational period.\nInitial Unified Command Meeting\nIf a Unified Command is managing the incident, the Initial Unified\nCommand Meeting allows members of the Unified Command to meet in\nprivate to discuss each jurisdiction or organization’s priorities and objectives\nas well as any limitations, concerns, and restrictions. During the Initial\nUnified Command Meeting, members of the Unified Command generally\naccomplish the next step by developing the initial joint incident objectives.\nObjectives Development/Update\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command establishes the incident\nobjectives for the initial operational period.

When the members of the team clearly understand the intent behind\ntheir instructions, they are better equipped to act decisively and make good\ndecisions.\nStrategy Meeting/Command and General Staff Meeting\nAfter developing or revising the incident objectives, the Incident Commander\nor Unified Command typically meets with the Command and General Staff,\nand sometimes others, to discuss the incident objectives and provide\ndirection. This meeting may be called the Strategy Meeting or the Command\nand General Staff Meeting and is held as needed to determine how best to\nmeet the incident objectives.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting, which is held the first time through the planning\ncycle, is particularly important, because it allows team members to share\ninformation and jointly determine the initial approach to response operations.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting may include the initial Incident Commander and\na representative from the Agency Administrator.\nPreparing for the Tactics Meeting\nOnce the approach to achieving or working toward achieving the incident\nobjectives is determined, the Operations Section Chief and staff prepare for\nthe Tactics Meeting by developing tactics and determining the resources that\nwill be applied during the operational period.\nTactics Meeting\nThe Tactics Meeting is a forum for key players to review the proposed tactics\ndeveloped by the Operations Section staff and to conduct planning for\nresource assignments. The Operations Section Chief leads the Tactics\nMeeting, and key participants include the Logistics Section Chief, Safety\nOfficer, a representative from the Planning Section—typically, the Resources\nUnit Leader—and other technical specialists or team members invited by the\nOperations Section Chief, Logistics Section Chief, or Safety Officer. The\nteam uses ICS Forms 215 and 215A, the Operational Planning Worksheet\nand the Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis, to facilitate and document\ndecisions they make during the meeting.\nPreparing for the Planning Meeting\nFollowing the Tactics Meeting, preparations begin for the Planning Meeting.\nTeam members collaborate between the Tactics Meeting and the Planning\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-193"

These briefings will be delivered to individual staff members or full\nunits within a section. These briefings occur at the beginning of the\nassignment to the incident and as necessary during the assignment. The\nsupervisor attempts to clarify tasks and scope of the work as well as define\nreporting schedule, subordinate responsibilities and delegated authority, and\nthe supervisor's expectations. The supervisor will also introduce coworkers\nand define actual workspace, sources of work supplies, and work schedule.\nField-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to operational tasks and/or\nwork at or near the incident site. These briefings will be delivered to\nindividual subordinates, full crews, or multiple crews such as Strike Teams\nor Task Forces and will occur at the beginning of an operational shift. The\nlocation will usually be near the work site or just prior to mobilization to the\nfield. The supervisor attempts to focus the subordinates on their specific\ntasks and helps define work area, reporting relationships, and expectations.\nSection-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves the briefing of an entire Section (Operations,\nPlanning, Logistics, or Finance/Administration) and is done by the specific\nSection Chief. These briefings occur at the beginning of the assignment to\nthe incident and after the arrival of Section supervisory staff. The Section\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-196"

A unique briefing in this category is the Operational\nPeriod Briefing (also called a Shift Operations Briefing). Here, the\nOperations Section Chief presents the plan for all operational elements for\nthe specific operational period. This specific briefing is done at the beginning\nof each operation shift and prior to the operational resources being deployed\nto the area of work. Often, a field-level briefing will take place subsequent to\nthe completion of the Operational Period Briefing.\nDuring any section-level briefing, the supervisor attempts to share incident-\nwide direction from the Incident Commander (IC), how the direction impacts\nthe Section staff, and specific ways the Section will support the IC's\ndirection. The supervisor will establish Section staffing requirements,\nSection work tasks, Section-wide scheduling rules, and overall timelines for\nmeetings and completion of work products.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-197"

Summarize the main learning points from this activity.\nIf not mentioned, below are possible answers:\nPublic Information Officer\nYou will probably need to designate a Public Information Officer (PIO) relatively early in the\nincident to interfaces the media and others needing incident information. This incident will\nattract media attention, and there will be public inquiries about incident casualties.\nSafety Officer\nYou may need to designate a Safety Officer to monitors incident operations and advise the\nIncident Commander on health and safety. A Safety officer is a legal requirement for any\nHazMat incident, but is also a good practice for any incident involving multiple hazards.\nLiaison Officer\nThe Liaison Officer serves as the incident command’s point of contact for organizations not\nincluded in the Command. You may have chosen not to activate this position. If you did it is\nlikely because you assess other agencies such as Public Health or Public works will have a role\nin the incident response.\nOperations Officer\nYou should certainly activate the Operations Section to plan and performs tactical activities to\nachieve the incident objectives. The size of this response operation will exceed what you can\nreasonably expect the Incident Commander to manage personally.\nPlanning Section\nYou might not initially assess that you require a Planning Section to collect, evaluate, and\ndisseminate incident information. The current assessment is that the incident will be resolved\nwithin a few hours. However, if you assess that this will extend into a second operational period\nthe establishment of a Plans Section becomes important. It allows Operations to focus on the\ncurrent operational period while Plans looks ahead to the next operational period.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-317"

A staging area manager under the Operations Section may be sufficient\nfor your initial resource management needs. However, as the incident increased in size,\ncomplexity it will take increasing time and resources. When you assess that the incident is\ncontinuing to grow in size and complexity you should establish a Logistics Chief to manage this\ndistinct function.\nFinance/Administration Section\nYou likely did not elect to establish a Finance/Administration Section because at this point the\nincident management activities do not require on-scene or incident-specific finance and\nadministrative support services. Again, when you assess that the incident is continuing to grow in\nsize and complexity you will have to consider establishing a Finance/Administration Section\nChief to manage this function.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-318"

A Unified Command with\nrepresentatives from the various jurisdictions and agencies involved in\nresponse to this incident, to include Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, and Public\nWorks may now be the best approach for Incident Command.\nNature and magnitude of the incident: This is now a Type 3 Incident.\nResource requirements will exceed the initial response resources you have on\nsite, the incident will extend into multiple operational periods, and additional\nICS Command and General Staff positions will have to be activated\nHazards and safety concerns: The number of concerns has increased.\nPriorities and resource requirements: While your current objectives are\nstill valid, there will be additional objectives associated with law\nActivity\nenforcement investigation, HazMat response, and Public Works actions that\nwill require the development of new objectives.

Property damage ran into the millions, and\nmany people died or were injured. The personnel assigned to determine the\ncauses of these outcomes studied the case histories and discovered that\nresponse problems could rarely be attributed to lack of resources or failure of\ntactics. Surprisingly, studies found that response problems were far more\nlikely to result from inadequate management than from any other single\nreason.\nICS:\n• Is a standardized management tool for meeting the demands of small\nInstructor\nor large emergency or nonemergency situations.\nNote\n• Represents “best practices” and has become the standard for\nemergency management across the country.\n• May be used for planned events, natural disasters, and acts of\nterrorism.\n• Is a key feature of the National Incident Management System\n(NIMS).\nICS is not just a standardized organizational chart, but an entire management\nsystem.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-33\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Why ICS?\nAll levels of government, the private sector, and\nnongovernmental agencies must be prepared to prevent, protect\nagainst, mitigate, respond to, and recover from a wide spectrum\nof major events and natural disasters that exceed the capabilities\nof any single entity. Threats from natural disasters and human-\ncaused events, such as terrorism, require a unified and\ncoordinated national approach to planning and to domestic\nincident management.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-34\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Homeland Security Presidential Directives\nHSPD-5, Management of Domestic Incidents, identified steps for\nimproved coordination in response to incidents. It required the Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS) to coordinate with other Federal departments\nand agencies and State, local, and tribal governments to establish a National\nResponse Framework (NRF) and a National Incident Management System\n(NIMS).\nHSPD-8, National Preparedness, directed DHS to lead a national initiative\nto develop a National Preparedness System—a common, unified approach to\n“strengthen the preparedness of the United States to prevent and respond to\nthreatened or actual domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other\nemergencies.”\nPresidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8), National Preparedness,\ndescribes the Nation's approach to preparedness-one that involves the whole\ncommunity, including individuals, businesses, community- and faith-based\norganizations, schools, tribes, and all levels of government (Federal, State,\nlocal, tribal and territorial).\nHSPD-5, HSPD-8, and PPD-8\nCopies of the HSPD-5, Management of Domestic Incidents, HSPD-8,\nNational Preparedness, and Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8), National\nPreparedness can be found online.

Actions to implement the use of NIMS take place at\ntwo levels - policy and organizational/operational.\nAt the policy level, implementing NIMS means government officials, i.e.,\ngovernors, mayors, county and city managers, tribal leaders, and others:\n• Adopt the NIMS through executive order, proclamation, or legislation\nas the jurisdiction's official incident response system; and\n• Direct that incident managers and response organizations in their\njurisdictions train, exercise, and use the NIMS in their response\noperations.\nAt the organizational/operational level, evidence that incident managers and\nemergency response organizations are implementing NIMS would include\nthe following:\n• NIMS is being integrated into functional and system-wide emergency\noperations policies, plans, and procedures.\n• NIMS training is planned or under way for responders, supervisors,\nand command level officers; and\n• Incident personnel at all levels are participating and/or coordinating\nexercises involving NIMS structures and responders from multiple\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-36\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\ndisciplines and jurisdictions.\nThe NIMS doctrine can be found at: www.fema.gov/national-incident-\nmanagement-system\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-37\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Major Components of NIMS\nJurisdictions and organizations involved in the management\nof incidents vary in their authorities, management\nstructures, communication capabilities and protocols, and\nmany other factors.\nThe major components of NIMS provide a common\nframework to integrate these diverse capabilities and\nachieve common goals.\nThe application of all three components is vital to\nsuccessful NIMS implementation.\nResource Management\nResource Management describes standard mechanisms to systematically\nmanage resources, including personnel, equipment, supplies, teams, and\nfacilities, both before and during incidents in order to allow organizations to\nNote\nmore effectively share resources when needed.\nCommand and Coordination\nCommand and Coordination describes leadership roles, processes, and\nrecommended organizational structures for incident management at the\noperational and incident support levels and explains how these structures\nNote\ninteract to manage incidents effectively and efficiently.\nCommunications and Information Management\nCommunications and Information Management describes systems and\nmethods that help to ensure that incident personnel and other decision makers\nhave the means and information they need to make and communicate\nNote\ndecisions.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-38\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nNIMS Management Characteristics\nThe following video will introduce the NIMS Management Characteristics\ndiscussed in detail in this unit.\nVideo Duration: 2 minutes, 30 seconds\nVideo\nNIMS Management Characteristics: Overview\nVideo Transcript\nAs you learned in the previous lesson, ICS is based on proven NIMS management principles,\nwhich contribute to the strength and efficiency of the overall system.\nICS incorporates a wide range of management features and principles, beginning with the use of\ncommon terminology.\n[David Burns, Emergency Preparedness Manager, University of California Los Angeles]\nCommunication is probably one of the most essential elements of ICS. It’s important that we\nknow how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River Authority] If the\nterms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to have a hard time\ncommunicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our mission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an\nIncident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your end\nobjective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So you can\nestablish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan, and you can ensure\nthat they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established under a\nsingle Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management Office]\nOne of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the same\nframework.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-39\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nICS helps ensure full utilization of all incident resources by:\n• Maintaining a manageable span of control\n• Establishing designated incident facilities and locations\n• Implementing comprehensive resource management practices\n• Defining clear processes for dispatch/ deployment of resources\n• Ensuring integrated communications\nICS supports responders and decision makers through effective information and intelligence\nmanagement.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] The common operating\npicture is a critical thing that the Coast Guard has been working hard on recently for ourselves\nbecause it’s something that helps us maintain a better operational picture and it’s more consistent\nacross the board, everyone up and down the chain of command and across to other agencies\nunderstand the same picture.\nICS counts on each of us taking personal accountability for our own actions. And finally, the\nmobilization process helps ensure that incident objectives can be achieved while responders\nremain safe.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] To have NIMS work\neffectively, it’s got to be top-down support.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics covered in this lesson form the basis for effective, team-\nbased incident response under the Incident Command System (ICS).\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-40\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 17: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nThis course builds on what you learned in ICS 100 about NIMS Management Characteristics.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics are listed below.\n• Integrated Communications\n• Common Terminology\n• Establishment and Transfer of\n• Modular Organization\nCommand\n• Management by Objectives\n• Unified Command\n• Incident Action Planning\n• Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Manageable Span of Control\nCommand\n• Incident Facilities and Locations\n• Accountability\n• Comprehensive Resource Management\n• Dispatch/Deployment\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-41\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nActivity 1.1\nActivity Purpose: To see how much you remember from ICS-100 about NIMS Management\nCharacteristics.\nTime: 35 minutes\nInstructions:\n• Divide into table teams.\n• Instructions:\nYour team will have 3 minutes to try to list as many NIMS Management\no\nCharacteristics as you can remember.

This is called\nManagement by Objectives.\nUnder ICS the Incident Commander (or Unified Command) establishes incident objectives.\nManagement by objectives includes:\n• Establishing specific, measurable objectives\n• Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks, and activities to achieve the objectives\n• Developing and issuing assignments, plans, procedures and protocols to accomplish tasks\n• Documenting results against objectives to measure performance, facilitate corrective\nactions, and inform development of objectives for the next operational period\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-44\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Action Planning\nIncident action planning guides incident management activities.\nAction Plans:\n• Record and communicate incident objectives, tactics, and assignments for operations and\nsupport\n• Are recommended for all incidents\n• Are not always written, but a written IAP is increasingly important when an incident or\nactivation:\nIs likely to extend beyond one operational period\no\nBecomes more complex\no\nInvolves multiple jurisdictions or agencies\no\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Manageable Span of Control\nSpan of control refers to the number of subordinates that directly report to a supervisor.\nMaintaining an appropriate span of control ensures effective incident management by enabling\nsupervisors to:\n• Direct and supervise subordinates\n• Communicate with and manage resources\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, the 1:5 ratio is only a guideline and effective incident management often calls for\ndifferent ratios.\nWhen a supervisor’s span of control becomes unmanageable, they can assign subordinate\nsupervisors or redistribute subordinates to manage portions of the organization in order to regain\na manageable span of control.\nSpan of control can change based on:\n• Type of incident\n• Nature of the task\n• Existing hazards and safety factors\n• Distances between personnel and resources\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Facilities and Locations\nThe Incident Commander, Unified Command or EOC director establishes incident support\nfacilities for specific purposes.\nThese facilities are identified and located based on the requirements of the situation.\nIncident size and complexity will influence the designation of facilities and locations.\nTypical designated facilities include:\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-45\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\n• Incident Command Post (ICP)\n• Incident base\n• Staging Areas\n• Camps\n• Mass casualty triage areas\n• Points-of-distribution\n• Emergency shelters\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Comprehensive Resource\nManagement\nMaintaining accurate and up-to-date inventories of resources is an essential component of\nincident management.\nResources include personnel, equipment, teams, supplies, and facilities available or potentially\navailable for assignment or allocation.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Integrated Communications\nIntegrated communications allow units from diverse agencies to connect, share information and\nachieve situational awareness.\nIncident managers facilitate communications through the development and use of:\n• A common communications plan\n• Interoperable communications processes and systems\n• Systems that include both voice and data links\nIntegrated Communications Planning occurs both before and during an incident to provide\nequipment, systems, and protocols needed to achieve integrated voice and data communications.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand\nWhen an incident is anticipated or occurs the organization with primary responsibility for the\nincident establishes command by designating the Incident Commander (IC) or Unified\nCommand (UC). Command may need to be transferred to a different IC/UC one or more times\nover the course of a long duration or increasingly complex incident.\nThe current command determines the protocol for transferring command. This transfer process\nshould always include a briefing for the incoming IC/UC on all essential information for\ncontinuing safe and effective operations. The transfer of command should also be communicated\nto all incident personnel.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-46\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Unified Command\nIn some incidents the Incident Command function is performed by a Unified Command (UC).\nUC is typically used for incidents involving:\n• Multiple jurisdictions\n• A single jurisdiction with multiagency involvement\n• Multiple jurisdictions with multiagency involvement\nUC allows agencies with different authorities and responsibilities to work together effectively\nwithout affecting individual agency authority, responsibility, or accountability.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Chain of Command and Unity\nof Command\nChain of command refers to the orderly command hierarchy within an incident management\norganization.\nUnity of command means that each individual reports to only one designated supervisor.\nThese principles:\n• Clarify reporting relationships\n• Eliminate confusion caused by conflicting instructions\n• Enable incident managers at all levels to direct the actions of all personnel under their\nsupervision\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Accountability\nAccountability for all resources during an incident is essential.\nIncident management personnel should adhere to principles of accountability, including:\n• Check-in/checkout\n• Incident action planning\n• Unity of command\n• Personal responsibility\n• Span of control\n• Resource tracking\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Dispatch/Deployment\nResources should deploy only when requested and dispatched through established procedures by\nappropriate authorities.\nResources that authorities do not request should not deploy spontaneously - unrequested\nresources can overburden the IC/UC and increase accountability challenges.\nLesson 1: Course Overview IG-47\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nIncident-related information and intelligence is managed by the incident management\norganization through established processes for:\n• Gathering\n• Analyzing\n• Assessing\n• Sharing\n• Managing\nInformation and intelligence management includes identifying essential elements of information\n(EEI).

Discussion questions focus on how to distinguish between “unity of\ncommand” and “Unified Command.”\nNext, formal and informal communication within ICS is described.\nThe unit then transitions to leadership concepts in incident management. Visuals are used to\npresent the common ICS leadership responsibilities and leadership values such as duty, respect,\nand integrity.\nNext, the unit presents communication responsibilities and required briefing elements. Following\na definition of incident management assessment, students identify the types of questions that they\nwould ask to assess the effectiveness of incident management.\nThe next section covers the use of common terminology and the ICS organization. A series of\nquestions is used to review the Command and General Staff positions and sections. Next the\nlesson emphasizes the importance of manageable span of control as an ICS leadership tool and\nnotes that ICS modular organization concepts ensure that an optimal manageable span of control\nis maintained. The last topic covers the standard titles used for ICS supervisory positions.\nFor the flexible delivery version of the course, there are there activities included. The purpose of\nActivity 2.1 is for the students to practice recognizing potential incident management\nissues. They are given a scenario and asked to identify potential management issues. The\npurpose of Activity 2.2 is to allow students to practice identifying communication strategies to\navoid problems during incident operations. Students are provided a scenario and will list\nstrategies on chart paper and report out to the group. Activity 2.3 is designed to stimulate\nthought and discussion about desirable leadership qualities. Students must identify important\nleadership qualities and how they relate to incident response.\nKnowledge checks are strategically embedded throughout the lessons in the online version of the\ncourse so students may assess their level of retained and recalled learning of the instructional\ncontent.\nTime Plan\nA suggested time plan for this unit is shown below. More or less time may be required, based on\nthe experience level of the group.\nTopic Time",

He sent two firefighters on foot to\nrecord the identification number and location of each piece of equipment on\nthe Pentagon grounds because radio communications could not be employed\nto perform this task. Foot messengers often proved to be the most reliable\nmeans of communications during the initial rescue efforts. Fortunately, a\nsurplus of personnel was available at the incident site to serve in that\ncapacity.

The IC has overall\nNote\nauthority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is\nresponsible for the management of all incident operations at the\nincident site.\n• Command Staff: The Command Staff consists of:\nLiaison Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible\no\nfor coordinating with representatives from cooperating and\nassisting agencies. The Liaison Officer may have Assistants.\nPublic Information Officer: A member of the Command Staff\no\nresponsible for interfacing with the public and media or with\nother agencies with incident-related information requirements.\nSafety Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible for\no\nmonitoring and assessing safety hazards or unsafe situations, and\nfor developing measures for ensuring personnel safety. The Safety\nOfficer may have Assistants.\n• General Staff: The organization level having functional\nresponsibility for primary segments of incident management\n(Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance/Administration). The\nSection level is organizationally between Branch and Incident\nCommander. Sections are as follows:\nOperations Section: The Operations Section responsible for all\no\ntactical operations at the incident. The Operations Section\nincludes:\n Branch: That organizational level having functional,\ngeographical, or jurisdictional responsibility for major\nparts of the incident operations. The Branch level is\norganizationally between Section and Division/Group\nin the Operations Section, and between Section and\nUnits in the Logistics Section. Branches are identified\nby the use of Roman numerals, by function, or by\njurisdictional name.\n Division: That organization level having responsibility\nfor operations within a defined geographic area. The\nDivision level is organizationally between the Strike\nTeam and the Branch.\n Group: Groups are established to divide the incident\ninto functional areas of operation. Groups are located\nbetween Branches (when activated) and Resources in\nthe Operations Section.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-87\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\n Unit: That organization element having functional\nresponsibility for a specific incident planning,\nlogistics, or finance activity.\n Task Force: A group of resources with common\ncommunications and a leader that may be\npreestablished and sent to an incident or formed at an\nincident.\n Strike Team/Resource Team: Specified\ncombinations of the same kind and type of resources,\nwith common communications and a leader.\n Single Resource: An individual, a piece of equipment\nand its personnel complement, or an established crew\nor team of individuals with an identified work\nsupervisor, that can be used on an incident.\nPlanning Section: Responsible for the collection, evaluation, and\no\ndissemination of information related to the incident, and for the\npreparation and documentation of the Incident Action Plan. The\nPlanning Section also maintains information on the current and\nforecasted situation, and on the status of resources assigned to the\nincident. This Section includes the Situation, Resources,\nDocumentation, and Demobilization Units, as well as Technical\nSpecialists.\nLogistics Section: The Section responsible for providing\no\nfacilities, services, and materials for the incident. Includes the\nService Branch (Communications Unit, Medical Unit, and Food\nUnit) and Support Branch (Supply Unit, Facilities Unit, and\nGround Support Unit).\nFinance/Administration Section: The Section responsible for all\no\nincident costs and financial considerations. The\nFinance/Administration Section includes the Time Unit,\nProcurement Unit, Compensation/Claims Unit, and Cost Unit.\nIntelligence/Investigations (I/I) Function: Some incidents\no\ninvolve intensive intelligence gathering and investigative activity,\nand for such incidents, the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand may reconfigure intelligence and investigations\nresponsibilities to meet the needs of the incident. The purpose of\nthe Intelligence/Investigations function is to ensure that\nintelligence and investigative operations and activities are\nproperly managed and coordinated.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-88\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: NIMS Management: Manageable Span of\nControl\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, effective incident management frequently necessitates ratios significantly different\nfrom this. The 1:5 ratio is a guideline, and incident personnel use their best judgment to\ndetermine the actual distribution of subordinates to supervisors for a given incident or EOC\nactivation.\nSpan of control is key to effective and efficient incident management.\nMaintaining an effective span of control is important because safety and\naccountability are a priority.\nNote\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-89\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Span of Control\nWhat influences span of control?\nAnswer:\nSpan-of-control ratios can be driven by a number of factors such as:\n• Type of incident\n• Nature of the task\n• Hazards and safety factors\n• Experience of the supervisor and subordinates\n• Communication access between the subordinates and the supervisor\nImportant Note: Planning is critical in order to avoid runaway ordering of\nInstructor resources and the loss of an effective span of control.\nNote Provide examples from personal experience of incidents that would use a\nspan of control of three or four subordinates to a supervisor. Ask the\nparticipants for additional examples.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-90\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Modular Organization\nThe ICS organization adheres to a \"form\nfollows function\" philosophy. The size of the\ncurrent organization and that of the next\noperational period is determined through the\nincident planning process.\nBecause the ICS is a modular concept,\nmanaging span of control is accomplished by\norganizing resources into Teams, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections. When the\nsupervisor-to-subordinate ratio exceeds\nmanageable span of control, additional Teams,\nDivisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections can\nbe established. When a supervisor is managing\ntoo few subordinates, Sections, Branches,\nDivisions, Groups, or Teams can be\nreorganized or demobilized to reach a more\neffective span of control.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-91\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Typical Organizational Structure\nThe initial response to most domestic incidents is\ntypically handled by local \"911\" dispatch centers,\nemergency responders within a single jurisdiction, and\ndirect supporters of emergency responders. Most\nresponses need go no further.\nApproximately 95% of all incidents are small\nresponses that include:\n• Command: Incident Commander and other\nCommand Staff\n• Single Resource: An individual, a piece of\nequipment and its personnel complement, or\nan established crew or team of individuals with\nan identified work supervisor that can be used\non an incident\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-92\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Expanding Incidents\nIncidents that begin with single resources may rapidly expand requiring significant additional\nresources and operational support.\nPresent the following key points:\nExpanding incidents may add supervisory layers to the organizational\nstructure as needed.\nInstructor\nNote\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-93\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Use of Position Titles\nAt each level within the ICS organization, individuals\nwith primary responsibility positions have distinct\ntitles. Using specific ICS position titles serves these\nimportant purposes:\n• Provides a common standard\n• Ensures qualified individuals fill positions\n• Ensures that requested personnel are qualified\n• Standardizes communication\n• Describes the responsibilities of the position\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-94\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 33: ICS Supervisory Position Titles\nTitles for all ICS supervisory levels are shown in the table below:\nOrganizational Level Title Support Position\nIncident Command Incident Commander Deputy\nCommand Staff Officer Assistant\nGeneral Staff (Section) Chief Deputy\nBranch Director Deputy\nDivision/Group Supervisor N/A\nUnit Unit Leader Manager\nStrike Team/Task Force Leader Single Resource Boss\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command IG-95\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 34: Discussion Question\nHow you would adjust the organizational strategy to maintain span of control for the scenario\nbelow?

The most common preparedness\nplans are:\n• Federal, State, or local Emergency Operations Plans (EOPs)\n• Standard operating guidelines (SOGs) - a standard indication or\noutline of policy\n• Standard operating procedures (SOPs) - a set of step-by-step\ninstructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out\ncomplex operations\n• Jurisdictional or agency policies\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-128\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 25: Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)\nEOPs are developed at the Federal, State, and local levels to\nprovide a uniform response to all hazards that a community\nmay face.\nEOPs should be consistent with the National Incident\nManagement System (NIMS).\nVisit this website to access the NIMS Resource\nCenter: https://www.fema.gov/national-incident-management-\nsystem\nVisit this website to access the Comprehensive Preparedness\nGuide (CPG) 101: A Guide for All-Hazard Emergency\nOperations\nPlanning: https://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/divisions/npd/CPG\n_101_V2.pdf\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-129\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 26: Mutual Aid Agreements and Compacts\nNIMS states that:\n• Mutual aid agreements establish the legal basis\nfor two or more entities to share resources.\nMutual aid agreements may authorize mutual\naid between two or more neighboring\ncommunities, among all jurisdictions within a\nstate, between states, between Federal agencies,\nand/or internationally.\n• Jurisdictions should be party to agreements with\nthe appropriate jurisdictions and/or\norganizations from which they expect to receive,\nor to which they expect to provide, assistance.\nVisit this website to review the Resource Management\nand Mutual Aid page within the NIMS Resource\nCenter: https://www.fema.gov/resource-management-\nmutual-aid\nPresent the following key points:\nNote: The United States has a trust relationship with Indian tribes and\nrecognizes their right to self-government. As such, tribal governments are\nresponsible for coordinating resources to address actual or potential\nincidents. When local resources are not adequate, tribal leaders seek\nassistance from States or the Federal Government.\nFor certain types of Federal assistance, tribal governments work with the\nState, but as sovereign entities they can elect to deal directly with the Federal\nInstructor\nGovernment for other types of assistance. In order to obtain Federal\nNote\nassistance via the Stafford Act, a State Governor must request a Presidential\ndeclaration on behalf of a tribe.\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-130\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: Mutual Aid Agreements and Compacts\n(Continued)\nMutual aid is the voluntary provision of resources by\nagencies or organizations to assist each other when\nexisting resources are inadequate.\nNIMS resource management describes how mutual aid\nallows jurisdictions to share resources among mutual aid\npartners.\nMutual Aid Agreement Topics\nMutual aid agreements might include some of the following topics:\n• Reimbursement: Mutual aid services are either paid or unpaid (e.g.,\nNote based on providing reciprocal services). Some mutual aid agreements\nspecify reimbursement parameters.\n• Recognition of Licensure and Certification: Guidelines to ensure\nrecognition of licensures across geopolitical boundaries.\n• Procedures for Mobilization (Request, Dispatch, and Response):\nSpecific procedures for parties to request and dispatch resources\nthrough mutual aid.\n• Protocols for Voice and Data Interoperability: Protocols that\nspecify how different communications and IT systems share\ninformation.\n• Protocols for Resource Management: Standard templates for\npackaging resources based on NIMS resource typing definitions\nand/or local inventory systems.\nPresent the following key points:\nAt a minimum, mutual aid agreements should include the following elements\nor provisions:\n• Definitions of key terms used in the agreement\n• Roles and responsibilities of individual parties\n• Procedures for requesting and providing assistance\nInstructor\n• Procedures, authorities, and rules for payment, reimbursement, and\nNote\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-131\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nallocation of cost\n• Notification procedures\n• Protocols for interoperable communications\n• Relationships with other agreements among jurisdictions\n• Workers compensation\n• Treatment of liability and immunity\n• Recognition of qualifications and certifications\n• Sharing agreements, as required\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives IG-132\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Mutual Aid and Assistance: All Levels\nMutual aid agreements and assistance agreements are used at all\nlevels of government:\n• Local jurisdictions participate in mutual aid through\nagreements with neighboring jurisdictions.\n• States can participate in mutual aid through the\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC).\n• Federal agencies offer mutual aid to each other and to\nStates, tribes, and territories under the National\nResponse Framework (NRF).\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)\nEMAC is a congressionally ratified mutual aid compact that defines a non-\nFederal, state-to-state system for sharing resources across state lines during\nan emergency or disaster. Signatories include all 50 states, the District of\nNote\nColumbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The PIO gathers,\nverifies, coordinates, and disseminates\naccessible,15 meaningful, and timely\ninformation on the incident for both internal\nand external audiences. The PIO also monitors\nthe media and other sources of public\ninformation to collect relevant information and\ntransmits this information to the appropriate\ncomponents of the incident management\norganization. In incidents that involve PIOs\nfrom different agencies, the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command designates\none as the lead PIO. All PIOs should work in a\nunified manner, speaking with one voice, and\nensure that all messaging is consistent. The\nIncident Commander or Unified Command\napproves the release of incident-related\ninformation. In large-scale incidents, the PIO\nparticipates in or leads the Joint Information\nCenter (JIC).\nSafety Officer The Safety Officer monitors incident\noperations and advises the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command on matters\nrelating to the health and safety of incident\npersonnel. Ultimate responsibility for the safe\nconduct of incident management rests with the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command and\nsupervisors at all levels. The Safety Officer is\nresponsible to the Incident Commander or\nUnified Command for establishing the systems\nand procedures necessary to assess,\ncommunicate, and mitigate hazardous\nenvironments. This includes developing and\nmaintaining the incident Safety Plan,\ncoordinating multiagency safety efforts, and\nimplementing measures to promote the safety\nof incident personnel and incident sites.

As the incident\ngrows in scope and the number of resources needed increases,\nthere may be a need to activate Teams, Units, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections to maintain an appropriate span\nof control. The optimal span of control for incident\nmanagement is one supervisor to five subordinates; however,\neffective incident management may require ratios different from\nthis. The 1:5 ratio is just a guideline.\nThe ability to delegate the supervision of resources not only\nfrees up the Incident Commander to perform critical decision-\nmaking and evaluation duties, but also clearly defines the lines\nof communication to everyone involved in the incident.\nNext, we'll review the major organizational elements that may\nbe activated during an expanding incident.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-156\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Operations Section\nThe Operations Section:\n• Directs and coordinates all incident tactical\noperations\n• Is typically one of the first organizations to be\nassigned to the incident\n• Expands from the bottom up\n• Has the most incident resources\n• May have Staging Areas and special\norganizations\nPresent the following key point:\nThe Operations Section is responsible for all activities focused on reducing\nthe immediate hazard, saving lives and property, establishing situational\ncontrol, and restoring normal operations.\nInstructor\nNote\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-157\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: Operations Section Chief\nThe Operations Section Chief:\n• Is responsible to the Incident Commander for\nthe direct management of all incident-related\noperational activities\n• Establishes tactical objectives for each\noperational period\n• Has direct involvement in the preparation of\nthe Incident Action Plan\nThe Operations Section Chief may have one or more\nDeputies assigned.

When I/I is required for\nspecialized types of responses, the IC/UC can place the I/I function in multiple locations within\nthe incident command structure based on factors such as the nature of the incident, the level of I/I\nactivity, and the relationship of I/I to other incident activities. The I/I can be placed in the\nPlanning Section, in the Operations Section, within the Command Staff, as a separate General\nStaff section, or in some combination of these locations.\nIntelligence/Investigations Functional Guidance\nThe Intelligence/Investigations Functional Guidance and Field Operations\nGuide, published October 2013, defined Intelligence/ Investigations as a\nseparate function. This function can be established in a variety of different\nways including as a branch under Operations or as a fifth General Staff\nSection within the ICS structure.\nThe Intelligence/Investigations (I/I) Function is responsible for the\nmanagement, coordination, and direction of intelligence and investigation\noperations and activities.\nIncidents can involve multiple hazards and threats requiring multiple\nsimultaneous activities: life safety, evidence and crime scene preservation,\nand investigations of the cause of the incident. Incident Command must\nInstructor manage these sometimes competing priorities.\nNote\nThe I/I Function is flexible. The Incident Commander or Unified Command\ndetermine If the I/I is needed, and where it is best placed within the ICS\nstructure to effectively manage the incident. For many types of incidents I/I\nmay not be required at all. When I/I is implemented it can be established as a\nfifth General Staff Section, as a branch or group under the Operations\nSection, or even as a branch under the Plans Section.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions IG-175\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 33: Discussion Question\nWhen might the I/I function be established as a branch under Operations? As a fifth General\nStaff Section within the ICS structure? As a part of the Command Staff?\nAsk the students:\nWhen might the I/I function be established as a branch under Operations? As\na fifth General Staff Section within the ICS structure? As a part of the\nCommand Staff?\nAcknowledge the participants’ responses. If not mentioned by the\nparticipants, here are some possible examples:\nI/I Branch under the Operations Section when the I/I focus is on the tactical\nexecution of an investigation and the management of the associated\nintelligence. Placing the tactical execution of the investigation as a separate\nbranch under operations can help to ensure that the investigation is\nsynchronized with other lifesaving, hazard reduction and property and\nenvironmental protection activities. For example if there is an incident\nresponse with concurrent lifesaving and investigation activities, it may be\nbeneficial to establish an I/I Branch under Operations.\nI/I Branch under the Planning Section when the I/I function is primarily\nInstructor\nrelated to situational awareness or planning efforts. Placing SA and planning\nNote\nrelated intelligence and investigation activities in an I/I Branch under\nplanning can ensure that these activities are synched with the other activities\nof the Planning Section. For example, If there is an incident that requires\nsensitive or classified information gathering and analysis, and there is not a\nsignificant on the ground tactical investigative effort, it may be beneficial to\nestablish an I/I Branch under Planning.\nThe I/I Function should be established as a General Staff Section when a\ncriminal or terrorist act is involved and the nature and specifics of the\nincident, in addition to legal constraints, could restrict the type and scope of\ninformation that may be readily shared. The establishment of an I/I Section\nallows for this information to be compartmentalized from the greater\nresponse effort.

In addition to these\nIAP related meetings, there will also be other\nmeetings and briefings within the ICS\norganization to include section-level meetings\nand briefings, situation update briefings, and\ntransfer of command briefings.\nIncident Action Planning Process\nExplain: The leg of the “P” describes the initial stages of an incident, when\npersonnel work to gain awareness of the situation and establish the\norganization for incident management. Incident personnel perform the steps\nin the leg of the “P” only one time. Once they are accomplished, incident\nmanagement shifts into a cycle of planning and operations, informed by\nInstructor\nongoing situational awareness and repeated each operational period.\nNote\nOperational Period Planning Cycle\nInitial Response and Assessment\nNote\nThe responder(s) who is first to arrive at the incident scene conducts the\ninitial assessment and takes whatever immediate response actions are\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-191\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nappropriate and possible. The initial or rapid assessment is essential to\ngaining and maintaining situational awareness. It enables the Incident\nCommander to request additional resources and/or support, develop, and\nimplement initial tactics. Jurisdiction officials might decide to activate an\nEOC based on the initial assessment.\nAgency Administrator Briefing\nThe Agency Administrator Briefing is a presentation to the personnel who\nwill be managing or supporting the incident by the administrator or other\nsenior official of the jurisdiction, agency, or organization affected by the\nincident. This briefing occurs when the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand are assuming duties outside their normal responsibilities or are\nfrom an entity or jurisdictional area that does not possess authority to the\nmanage the incident they are being assigned. In such cases, the briefing\nprovides supporting details to the delegation of authority or other document\nthat the jurisdiction, agency, or organization typically provides to the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nDuring the briefing, the agency administrator or a designee provides\ninformation, guidance, and direction—including priorities and constraints—\nnecessary for the successful management of the incident. The briefing is\nintended to ensure a common understanding between the jurisdiction,\nagency, or organization and the incident personnel regarding such things as\nthe environmental, social, political, economic, and cultural issues relevant to\nthe incident and its location.\nIncident Briefing\nThe incident briefing marks the transition from reactive to proactive incident\nmanagement. The initial responder(s) typically delivers the briefing to the\nincoming Incident Commander or Unified Command. This meeting enables\nthe incoming Incident Commander or Unified Command to initiate planning\nfor the next operational period.\nInitial Unified Command Meeting\nIf a Unified Command is managing the incident, the Initial Unified\nCommand Meeting allows members of the Unified Command to meet in\nprivate to discuss each jurisdiction or organization’s priorities and objectives\nas well as any limitations, concerns, and restrictions. During the Initial\nUnified Command Meeting, members of the Unified Command generally\naccomplish the next step by developing the initial joint incident objectives.\nObjectives Development/Update\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command establishes the incident\nobjectives for the initial operational period. After the initial operational\nperiod, the Incident Commander or Unified Command reviews the incident\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-192\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nobjectives and may validate them, modify them, or develop new objectives.\nIncident objectives are based on incident priorities and other requirements.\nClearly communicated priorities and objectives support unity of effort among\nincident personnel and enable the development of appropriate strategies and\ntactics. When the members of the team clearly understand the intent behind\ntheir instructions, they are better equipped to act decisively and make good\ndecisions.\nStrategy Meeting/Command and General Staff Meeting\nAfter developing or revising the incident objectives, the Incident Commander\nor Unified Command typically meets with the Command and General Staff,\nand sometimes others, to discuss the incident objectives and provide\ndirection. This meeting may be called the Strategy Meeting or the Command\nand General Staff Meeting and is held as needed to determine how best to\nmeet the incident objectives.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting, which is held the first time through the planning\ncycle, is particularly important, because it allows team members to share\ninformation and jointly determine the initial approach to response operations.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting may include the initial Incident Commander and\na representative from the Agency Administrator.\nPreparing for the Tactics Meeting\nOnce the approach to achieving or working toward achieving the incident\nobjectives is determined, the Operations Section Chief and staff prepare for\nthe Tactics Meeting by developing tactics and determining the resources that\nwill be applied during the operational period.\nTactics Meeting\nThe Tactics Meeting is a forum for key players to review the proposed tactics\ndeveloped by the Operations Section staff and to conduct planning for\nresource assignments. The Operations Section Chief leads the Tactics\nMeeting, and key participants include the Logistics Section Chief, Safety\nOfficer, a representative from the Planning Section—typically, the Resources\nUnit Leader—and other technical specialists or team members invited by the\nOperations Section Chief, Logistics Section Chief, or Safety Officer. The\nteam uses ICS Forms 215 and 215A, the Operational Planning Worksheet\nand the Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis, to facilitate and document\ndecisions they make during the meeting.\nPreparing for the Planning Meeting\nFollowing the Tactics Meeting, preparations begin for the Planning Meeting.\nTeam members collaborate between the Tactics Meeting and the Planning\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-193\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nMeeting to identify support needs and assign specific operational resources\nto accomplish the operational plan.\nPlanning Meeting\nThe Planning Meeting serves as a final review and approval of operational\nplans and resource assignments developed during and after the Tactics\nMeeting. Ideally, the Planning Meeting involves no surprises and simply\nserves as a review of a plan that the Command and General Staff have\ncollaboratively developed and agreed upon. At the end of the Planning\nMeeting, Command and General Staff, and any agency officials involved,\nconfirm that they can support the plan.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-194\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Effective Meetings and Briefings\nEffective briefings and meetings are:\n• An essential element to good supervision and incident\nmanagement\n• Intended to pass along vital information required in the\ncompletion of incident response actions\nTypically, these briefings are concise and do not include long\ndiscussions or complex decision-making. Rather, they allow\nincident managers and supervisors to communicate specific\ninformation and expectations for the upcoming work period and\nto answer questions.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-195\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Levels of Briefings\nThere are three types of briefings/meetings used in ICS: staff\nlevel, field level, and section level.\n• Staff-level briefings are delivered to resources\nassigned to nonoperational and support tasks at the\nIncident Command Post or Base.\n• Field-level briefings are delivered to individual\nresources or crews who are assigned to operational\ntasks and/or work at or near the incident site.\n• Section-level briefings are delivered to an entire\nSection and include the Operational Period\nBriefing.\nBriefing Types\nStaff-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to nonoperational and\nNote support tasks that are commonly performed at the Incident Base or Command\nPost. These briefings will be delivered to individual staff members or full\nunits within a section. These briefings occur at the beginning of the\nassignment to the incident and as necessary during the assignment. The\nsupervisor attempts to clarify tasks and scope of the work as well as define\nreporting schedule, subordinate responsibilities and delegated authority, and\nthe supervisor's expectations. The supervisor will also introduce coworkers\nand define actual workspace, sources of work supplies, and work schedule.\nField-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to operational tasks and/or\nwork at or near the incident site. These briefings will be delivered to\nindividual subordinates, full crews, or multiple crews such as Strike Teams\nor Task Forces and will occur at the beginning of an operational shift. The\nlocation will usually be near the work site or just prior to mobilization to the\nfield. The supervisor attempts to focus the subordinates on their specific\ntasks and helps define work area, reporting relationships, and expectations.\nSection-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves the briefing of an entire Section (Operations,\nPlanning, Logistics, or Finance/Administration) and is done by the specific\nSection Chief. These briefings occur at the beginning of the assignment to\nthe incident and after the arrival of Section supervisory staff. The Section\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-196\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nChief may schedule periodic briefings at specific times (once per day) or\nwhen necessary. A unique briefing in this category is the Operational\nPeriod Briefing (also called a Shift Operations Briefing). Here, the\nOperations Section Chief presents the plan for all operational elements for\nthe specific operational period. This specific briefing is done at the beginning\nof each operation shift and prior to the operational resources being deployed\nto the area of work. Often, a field-level briefing will take place subsequent to\nthe completion of the Operational Period Briefing.\nDuring any section-level briefing, the supervisor attempts to share incident-\nwide direction from the Incident Commander (IC), how the direction impacts\nthe Section staff, and specific ways the Section will support the IC's\ndirection. The supervisor will establish Section staffing requirements,\nSection work tasks, Section-wide scheduling rules, and overall timelines for\nmeetings and completion of work products.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings IG-197\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Activity 5.1: Briefing Information\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at determining the appropriate details required when\npreparing for an incident briefing and identifying information pertinent to the audience to\nbe covered in the briefing.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your group:",

Other\nincidents will require some or all members of the\nCommand Staff and all sub-elements of each General\nStaff section.\nThe decision to activate an element (Section,\nBranch, Division, Group or Unit) must be based on\nincident objectives and resource needs.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-217\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Activation of Organizational Elements\n(Continued)\nAn important concept is that many organizational\nelements may be activated in various Sections without\nactivating the Section Chief.\nFor example, the Situation Unit can be activated without a\nPlanning Section Chief assigned. In this case, the\nsupervision of the Situation Unit will rest with the\nIncident Commander.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-218\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Discussion Question\nShould you combine ICS positions and titles in order to save on staffing or achieve a higher\nlevel of efficiency?\nAsk the participants:\nShould you combine ICS positions in order to save on staffing or achieve a\nhigher level of efficiency?

Rather than combining\npositions, you may assign the same individual to supervise multiple units.\nWhen assigning personnel to multiple positions, do not use nonstandard titles. Creating new\ntitles may be unrecognizable to assisting or cooperating personnel and may cause confusion.\nBe aware of potential span-of-control issues that may arise from assigning one person to\nmultiple positions.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-220\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Resource Management\nMaintaining an accurate and up-to-date picture of\nresource utilization is a critical component of\nincident management. The incident resource\nmanagement process consists of the following:\n• Identifying Requirements\n• Ordering and Acquiring\n• Mobilizing\n• Tracking and Reporting\n• Demobilizing\n• Reimbursing and Restocking\nThis section of the lesson reviews key resource\nmanagement principles.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-221\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Anticipating Incident Resource Needs\nExperience and training will help you to predict\nworkloads and corresponding staffing needs. As the\ngraphic illustrates, an incident may build faster than\nresources can arrive.\nEventually, a sufficient number of resources arrive\nand begin to control the incident. As the incident\ndeclines, resources then exceed incident needs.\nRemember that when resources increase or decrease\nyou will have to reassess your organizational\nstructure and staffing to determine if it is right-sized\nfor the resources that are being managed.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-222\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Predicting Incident Workload\nIncident workload patterns are often predictable throughout\nthe incident life cycle. Several examples are provided below:\n• Operations Section: The workload on Operations is\nimmediate and often massive. On a rapidly escalating\nincident, the Operations Section Chief must\ndetermine appropriate tactics; organize, assign, and\nsupervise resources; and at the same time participate\nin the planning process.\n• Planning Section: The Resources and Situation Units\nwill be very busy in the initial phases of the incident.\nIn the later stages, the workload of the\nDocumentation and Demobilization Units will\nincrease.\n• Logistics Section: The Supply and Communications\nUnits will be very active in the initial and final stages\nof the incident.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-223\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Analyzing Incident Complexity\nIt is important to strike the right balance when determining\nresource needs.

Incident types\nare based on the following five levels of complexity. (Source: U.S. Fire Administration)\nType 5 • The incident can be handled with one\nor two single resources with up to six\npersonnel.\n• Command and General Staff positions\n(other than the Incident Commander)\nare not activated.\n• No written Incident Action Plan (IAP)\nis required.\n• The incident is contained within the\nfirst operational period and often within\nan hour to a few hours after resources\narrive on scene.\n• Examples include a vehicle fire, an\ninjured person, or a police traffic stop.\nType 4 • Command staff and general staff\nfunctions are activated only if needed.\n• Several resources are required to\nmitigate the incident, including a Task\nForce or Strike Team.\n• The incident is usually limited to one\noperational period in the control phase.\n• The agency administrator may have\nbriefings, and ensure the complexity\nanalysis and delegation of authority are\nupdated.\n• No written Incident Action Plan (IAP)\nis required but a documented\noperational briefing will be completed\nfor all incoming resources.\n• The role of the agency administrator\nincludes operational plans including\nobjectives and priorities.\nType 3 • When capabilities exceed initial attack,\nthe appropriate ICS positions should be\nadded to match the complexity of the\nincident.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-250\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nType 5 • The incident can be handled with one\nor two single resources with up to six\npersonnel.\n• Command and General Staff positions\n(other than the Incident Commander)\nare not activated.\n• No written Incident Action Plan (IAP)\nis required.\n• The incident is contained within the\nfirst operational period and often within\nan hour to a few hours after resources\narrive on scene.\n• Examples include a vehicle fire, an\ninjured person, or a police traffic stop.\n• Some or all of the Command and\nGeneral Staff positions may be\nactivated, as well as Division/Group\nSupervisor and/or Unit Leader level\npositions.\n• A Type 3 Incident Management Team\n(IMT) or incident command\norganization manages initial action\nincidents with a significant number of\nresources, an extended attack incident\nuntil containment/control is achieved,\nor an expanding incident until transition\nto a Type 1 or 2 IMT.\n• The incident may extend into multiple\noperational periods.\n• A written IAP may be required for each\noperational period.\nType 2 • This type of incident extends beyond\nthe capabilities for local control and is\nexpected to go into multiple operational\nperiods. A Type 2 incident may require\nthe response of resources out of area,\nincluding regional and/or national\nresources, to effectively manage the\noperations, command, and general\nstaffing.\n• Most or all of the Command and\nGeneral Staff positions are filled.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-251\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nType 5 • The incident can be handled with one\nor two single resources with up to six\npersonnel.\n• Command and General Staff positions\n(other than the Incident Commander)\nare not activated.\n• No written Incident Action Plan (IAP)\nis required.\n• The incident is contained within the\nfirst operational period and often within\nan hour to a few hours after resources\narrive on scene.\n• Examples include a vehicle fire, an\ninjured person, or a police traffic stop.\n• A written IAP is required for each\noperational period.\n• Many of the functional units are needed\nand staffed.\n• Operations personnel normally do not\nexceed 200 per operational period and\ntotal incident personnel do not exceed\n500 (guidelines only).\n• The agency administrator is responsible\nfor the incident complexity analysis,\nagency administrator briefings, and the\nwritten delegation of authority.\nType 1 • This type of incident is the most\ncomplex, requiring national resources\nto safely and effectively manage and\noperate.\n• All Command and General Staff\npositions are filled.\n• Operations personnel often exceed 500\nper operational period and total\npersonnel will usually exceed 1,000.\n• Branches need to be established.\n• The agency administrator will have\nbriefings, and ensure that the\ncomplexity analysis and delegation of\nauthority are updated.\n• Use of resource advisors at the incident\nbase is recommended.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-252\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nType 5 • The incident can be handled with one\nor two single resources with up to six\npersonnel.\n• Command and General Staff positions\n(other than the Incident Commander)\nare not activated.\n• No written Incident Action Plan (IAP)\nis required.\n• The incident is contained within the\nfirst operational period and often within\nan hour to a few hours after resources\narrive on scene.\n• Examples include a vehicle fire, an\ninjured person, or a police traffic stop.\n• There is a high impact on the local\njurisdiction, requiring additional staff\nfor office administrative and support\nfunctions.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility IG-253\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 33: Lesson Completion\nYou have completed the Organizational Flexibility lesson.

The general rule is that the\njurisdiction or organization with primary responsibility for the incident will\nActivity\ndesignate the incident commander. In this scenario this incident occurred\nwithin the jurisdiction of Liberty County. However, at the outset Fire and\nEMS will likely have the largest role. The Fire resources are from Central\nCity and the EMS are from Liberty County. This is an incident that will\ninvolve multiple jurisdictions and agencies. A Unified Command with\nrepresentatives from the various jurisdictions and agencies involved in\nresponse to this incident, to include Fire/EMS, Law Enforcement and Public\nWorks is also a viable approach. If you chose this, remember that in a\nUnified Command, each organization in the Unified Command provides an\nIncident Commander, and this group of Commanders manage the incident\ntogether by establishing a common set of incident objectives.\nFor the purposes of this scenario, because it is an incident centered on\nremoving casualties from the area of the fire and suppressing the fire, a\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-284\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nsingle Incident Commander is sufficient.

If you did it is\nlikely because you assess other agencies such as Public Health or Public works will have a role\nin the incident response.\nOperations Officer\nYou should certainly activate the Operations Section to plan and performs tactical activities to\nachieve the incident objectives. The size of this response operation will exceed what you can\nreasonably expect the Incident Commander to manage personally.\nPlanning Section\nYou might not initially assess that you require a Planning Section to collect, evaluate, and\ndisseminate incident information. The current assessment is that the incident will be resolved\nwithin a few hours. However, if you assess that this will extend into a second operational period\nthe establishment of a Plans Section becomes important. It allows Operations to focus on the\ncurrent operational period while Plans looks ahead to the next operational period.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-317\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nLogistics Section\nInitially you may not assess that a separate Logistics Section is needed to manage services and\nsupport for the incident. A staging area manager under the Operations Section may be sufficient\nfor your initial resource management needs. However, as the incident increased in size,\ncomplexity it will take increasing time and resources. When you assess that the incident is\ncontinuing to grow in size and complexity you should establish a Logistics Chief to manage this\ndistinct function.\nFinance/Administration Section\nYou likely did not elect to establish a Finance/Administration Section because at this point the\nincident management activities do not require on-scene or incident-specific finance and\nadministrative support services. Again, when you assess that the incident is continuing to grow in\nsize and complexity you will have to consider establishing a Finance/Administration Section\nChief to manage this function.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-318\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 34: Scenario Part 2\nIt is now just after 6 p.m. and the situation appears to\nbe getting worse.\nThe initial assessment of several injuries was\nincorrect. There are over a dozen injuries and at least\nthree dead.\nThe vehicle fire spread quickly to the building,\nigniting a damaged natural gas line in a kitchen area.\nThe combination of explosion, fire, and collision\ndamage caused the building to partially collapse. The\nfire continues to burn and now threatens other\nsurrounding structures.\nThe crowds are under control, but traffic has not yet\ncompletely cleared from the area and continues to\nslow the ingress and egress of emergency\nmanagement resources.\nThe vehicle driver has not been found and the origin\nand contents of the large truck have not been\nidentified. This raises new concerns that this could\nhave been an intentional act and that the truck could\nhave been transporting something hazardous.\nThis incident has increased in size and complexity\nand will extend into at least one more operational\nperiod.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-319\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 35: Activity 8.7: Expanding Incident\nActivity Purpose: To apply key concepts to analyze incidents.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .",

Be prepared to present your answers to the class in 10 minutes.\nIncident Command: This is an incident that will now involve more\njurisdictions and agencies. Law Enforcement is concerned with investigation\nand crime scene preservation, and Hazardous Materials (HazMat) assessment\nmust be reconciled with your other priorities. A Unified Command with\nrepresentatives from the various jurisdictions and agencies involved in\nresponse to this incident, to include Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, and Public\nWorks may now be the best approach for Incident Command.\nNature and magnitude of the incident: This is now a Type 3 Incident.\nResource requirements will exceed the initial response resources you have on\nsite, the incident will extend into multiple operational periods, and additional\nICS Command and General Staff positions will have to be activated\nHazards and safety concerns: The number of concerns has increased.\nPriorities and resource requirements: While your current objectives are\nstill valid, there will be additional objectives associated with law\nActivity\nenforcement investigation, HazMat response, and Public Works actions that\nwill require the development of new objectives. These objectives will have to\nbe prioritized and additional resources will be needed to accomplish the\nobjectives.\nICS structure: The ICS structure will need to be expanded. Liaisons, a\nPlanning Section, a Logistics Section, and an Intelligence/Investigations\nfunction are some of the positions that should now be considered for\ninclusion in the Incident Command structure.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-320\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 36: Transfer of Command (Continued)\nThe initial Incident Commander may continue to\nserve as a member of a Unified Command. It is\nalso possible that the increase in complexity will\nlead to the appointment of more senior personnel\nto Incident Command.\nRemember that Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand is a NIMS Management\nCharacteristic. You must clearly state and record\nwhen command is transferred.\nThe Transfer of Command should be conducted\nto create minimal disruption to the incident.\nWhenever possible, the Transfer of Command\nshould include a complete briefing on the\nsituation conducted face to face with the new\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristic Incident\nAction Planning also applies here. Incident\nobjectives, tactics, and assignments for\noperations and support should be recorded and\ncommunicated through an Incident Action Plan\n(IAP). As your incident increased in size,\ncomplexity, and length, you should have started\nto document incident response activities in a\nwritten plan.\nThe ICS Form 201 is a standard format to record\nkey situational information and document\nactions taken on an incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity IG-321\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 37: Lesson Summary\nYou have completed the Application Activity.

These multiple agencies work together to\ncommunicate and make command decisions.\n• Communication during an incident may be formal or informal\nFormal communications must be used for work assignments, resource requests, and\no\nprogress reports.\nInformal communication is used to exchange incident or event information only.\no\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-328\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Lesson 2: Incident Command and Unified\nCommand\n• All levels of leadership on an incident should understand and practice the leadership\nprinciples, have a commitment to duty, and take actions that prioritize the safety of\npersonnel.\n• Clear communication is the responsibility of all responders in order to accomplish\nincident objectives. Incident Management Assessments may be conducted by leadership\nafter an incident to help personnel process what happened and why.\n• ICS utilizes a Modular Organization so that the organization can expand and contract as\nan incident grows and shrinks. This modular organization helps maintain an effective\nspan of control.\n• Manageable span of control with Modular Organization is accomplished by organizing\nresources into Teams, Divisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections. Leadership in each\norganizational level holds a unique title.\n• The flexibility allowed for in ICS does not override the importance of Common\nTerminology. Common Terminology must be used to maintain clear communication,\nwhether formal or informal.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-329\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• Authority is the right or obligation to act on behalf of a department, agency, or\njurisdiction.\n• The scope of authority that an Incident Commander has is determined by existing laws,\npolicies, and procedures. Additional authority may be delegated when necessary.\n• Delegation of authority is the process of granting authority to an individual or agency to\ncarry out specific functions during an incident.\n• Delegation of authority does NOT relieve the granting entity of the responsibility for that\nfunction. Authority can be delegated; responsibility cannot.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-330\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 6: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• When needed, a delegation of authority should contain elements related to restrictions,\nexternal implications and considerations, and planning and communication processes.\n• Authority is implemented by the Incident Commander through the management of\nobjectives. Effective Incident Objectives should be SMART. Objectives are not tactics or\nstrategies; they state what needs to be accomplished, not how to do it.\n• Objectives are a part of the Incident Action Plan, which is completed each operational\nperiod and outlines incident-specific information. It is created through a process known\nas the Operational Period Planning Cycle (Planning P).\n• Incident Command, as well as Command and General Staff, should also have a working\nknowledge of other preparedness plans, such as EOPs, SOGs, SOPs, and mutual aid\nagreements.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-331\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• The Incident Commander oversees the incident, sets incident objectives, and approves the\nIAP.\n• Command Staff include the Public Information Officer, Safety Officer, and Liaison\nOfficer.\n• The Incident Commander also oversees four sections of the ICS organizational structure:\nOperations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance & Administration. Each of these sections is\nresponsible for a different function during an incident; Sections are led by the General\nStaff who report to the Incident Commander. General Staff are titled as Section Chiefs.\n• Operations directs and coordinates all incident tactical operations.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-332\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• Planning maintains resource and situation status, prepares the IAP and other documents,\nand looks beyond the current operational period to anticipate potential future problems or\nevents.\n• Logistics is responsible for all support requirements, including communications, facility\nsupplies, medical needs, and food and drink for incident personnel.\n• Finance/Administration provides administrative and financial support services. This\nincludes handling claims related to property damage, injuries, and fatalities.\n• ICS Forms help communicate and organize information between Command, Command\nStaff, General Staff, and other incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-333\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Lesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Different meetings and briefings are used during the Incident Action Planning Process to\nshare information.\n• Briefings should be concise and may occur at the staff, field, or section level.\n• Information shared during a briefing includes the current situation and objectives, safety\nissues and emergency procedures, work tasks, facilities and work areas, communication\nprotocols, expectations, resource acquisition procedures, work schedules, and questions\nor concerns.\n• The Operational Period Briefing is led by the Incident Commander to present the IAP.\nCommand and General Staff will also participate to share important information.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-334\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Lesson 6: Organizational Flexibility\n• NIMS requires organizational standardization use of Common Terminology; however,\nICS is still flexible due to its Modular Organization.\n• Functions and positions within the organizational structure are activated and filled based\non the needs and demand of an incident. The ICS organizational structure will expand\nand contract with the incident.\n• Personnel may hold multiple titles within an incident's organizational structure, but the\ntitles must keep consistent with NIMS titles. Titles may not be shortened or combined.\n• Proper Resource Management is essential to maintaining an accurate and up-to-date\npicture of resource utilization and needs.\n• Incidents are typed based on size and complexity. Incident types move from Type 5 as\nthe least complex to Type 1 as the most complex.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-335\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Lesson 7: Transfer of Command\n• Transfer of Command is the process of moving the responsibility for incident command\nfrom one Incident Commander to another Incident Commander or Unified Command.\n• Transfer of Command should take place face-to-face when possible and include a\ncomplete briefing that captures essential information.\n• The transfer of command briefing should include elements such as the situation status,\nincident objectives and priorities, current organization, resource information, incident\ncommunications plan, etc.\n• A notification of the time and date that the transfer of command becomes effective should\nbe communicated to all incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-336\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Congratulations!\nYou should now be able to demonstrate knowledge of how to manage an initial response to an\nincident.\nThe course specifically discussed:\n• Incident Command and Unified Command\n• Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives\n• Functional Areas & Positions\n• Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Organizational Flexibility\n• Transfer of Command\n• Application of ICS for Initial Response\nLesson 9: Course Summary IG-337\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: IS-200.c Final Exam Instructions\nWhen the review is completed, follow these Final Exam instructions:",
