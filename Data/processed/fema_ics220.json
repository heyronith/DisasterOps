The Air Operations Summary (ICS 220) provides the Air Operations Branch with the number, type, location,\nand specific assignments of helicopters and air resources.\nPreparation. The ICS 220 is completed by the Operations Section Chief or the Air Operations Branch Director during\neach Planning Meeting. General air resources assignment information is obtained from the Operational Planning\nWorksheet (ICS 215), which also is completed during each Planning Meeting. Specific designators of the air resources\nassigned to the incident are provided by the Air and Fixed-Wing Support Groups. If aviation assets would be utilized for\nrescue or are referenced on the Medical Plan (ICS 206), coordinate with the Medical Unit Leader and indicate on the ICS\n206.\nDistribution. After the ICS 220 is completed by Air Operations personnel, the form is given to the Air Support Group\nSupervisor and Fixed-Wing Coordinator personnel. These personnel complete the form by indicating the designators of\nthe helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft assigned missions during the specified operational period.
