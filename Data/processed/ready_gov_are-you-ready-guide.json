Most importantly, it may help you stay safe in a disaster and give you\npeace of mind. Consider making plans for evacuation, communication, and to protect critical\ndocuments and your property.\nCreate a Family Emergency Communication Plan\nKnow how to contact and meet family members before, during, or after a disaster by making a\nFamily Emergency Communication Plan. The first step is to collect all contact information from\nyour family and add it to the communication plan. Include contact information for other important\npeople or organizations as well, such as medical facilities, doctors, schools, or service providers.\nYou should also set an out-of-state point of contact, which enables everyone in your family to share\nupdates through that person if local communication is unavailable. Be sure to have at least two\nforms of contact for that person.\nYou may also use social media as an important method of communication with your family.\nEncourage your entire family to sign up for social media applications such as Facebook Safety Check\nor American Red Cross Safe and Well.\nMake sure everyone understands the Family Emergency Communication Plan and carries a digital\nor wallet card copy at all times. You should also post a copy in a central location in your home, such\nas on your refrigerator or family bulletin board. You can find premade templates to build wallet\ncards and large print plans at Ready.gov. It is vital that your family practice your plan once you have\ndeveloped it—just like you would a fire drill.

Post-\ndisaster economic assistance programs may be available for some people. Direct help with food,\nshelter, supplies, and cleanup efforts can come from many organizations, including the American\nRed Cross, the Salvation Army, and local volunteer organizations. Following major disasters, the\nFederal Government can also provide support to people through temporary housing, counseling\n(for post-disaster trauma), low-interest loans and grants, and in other ways. The Federal\nGovernment also has programs that help small businesses and farmers.\nMost Federal aid becomes available when the President of the United States declares a “Major\nDisaster” for the affected area.
