SM-13\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Incident Command System (ICS)\nICS:\n• Is a standardized management tool for meeting the\ndemands of small or large emergency or nonemergency\nsituations\n• Represents \"best practices,\" and has become the standard\nfor emergency management across the country\n• May be used for planned events, natural disasters, and\nacts of terrorism\n• Is a part of the National Incident Management System\n(NIMS)\nICS is not just a standardized organizational chart, but an entire\nmanagement system.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-14\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Why ICS?\nAll levels of government, the private sector, and\nnongovernmental agencies must be prepared to prevent, protect\nagainst, mitigate, respond to, and recover from a wide spectrum\nof major events and natural disasters that exceed the capabilities\nof any single entity. Threats from natural disasters and human-\ncaused events, such as terrorism, require a unified and\ncoordinated national approach to planning and to domestic\nincident management.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-15\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Homeland Security Presidential Directives\nHSPD-5, Management of Domestic Incidents, identified steps for\nimproved coordination in response to incidents. It required the Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS) to coordinate with other Federal departments\nand agencies and State, local, and tribal governments to establish a National\nResponse Framework (NRF) and a National Incident Management System\n(NIMS).\nHSPD-8, National Preparedness, directed DHS to lead a national initiative\nto develop a National Preparedness System—a common, unified approach to\n“strengthen the preparedness of the United States to prevent and respond to\nthreatened or actual domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other\nemergencies.”\nPresidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8), National Preparedness,\ndescribes the Nation's approach to preparedness-one that involves the whole\ncommunity, including individuals, businesses, community- and faith-based\norganizations, schools, tribes, and all levels of government (Federal, State,\nlocal, tribal and territorial).\nHSPD-5, HSPD-8, and PPD-8\nCopies of the HSPD-5, Management of Domestic Incidents, HSPD-8,\nNational Preparedness, and Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8), National\nPreparedness can be found online.

Actions to implement the use of NIMS take place at\ntwo levels - policy and organizational/operational.\nAt the policy level, implementing NIMS means government officials, i.e.,\ngovernors, mayors, county and city managers, tribal leaders, and others:\n• Adopt the NIMS through executive order, proclamation, or legislation\nas the jurisdiction's official incident response system; and\n• Direct that incident managers and response organizations in their\njurisdictions train, exercise, and use the NIMS in their response\noperations.\nAt the organizational/operational level, evidence that incident managers and\nemergency response organizations are implementing NIMS would include\nthe following:\n• NIMS is being integrated into functional and system-wide emergency\noperations policies, plans, and procedures.\n• NIMS training is planned or under way for responders, supervisors,\nand command level officers; and\n• Incident personnel at all levels are participating and/or coordinating\nexercises involving NIMS structures and responders from multiple\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-17\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\ndisciplines and jurisdictions.\nThe NIMS doctrine can be found at: www.fema.gov/national-incident-\nmanagement-system\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-18\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Major Components of NIMS\nJurisdictions and organizations involved in the management\nof incidents vary in their authorities, management\nstructures, communication capabilities and protocols, and\nmany other factors.\nThe major components of NIMS provide a common\nframework to integrate these diverse capabilities and\nachieve common goals.\nThe application of all three components is vital to\nsuccessful NIMS implementation.\nResource Management\nResource Management describes standard mechanisms to systematically\nmanage resources, including personnel, equipment, supplies, teams, and\nfacilities, both before and during incidents in order to allow organizations to\nNote\nmore effectively share resources when needed.\nCommand and Coordination\nCommand and Coordination describes leadership roles, processes, and\nrecommended organizational structures for incident management at the\noperational and incident support levels and explains how these structures\nNote\ninteract to manage incidents effectively and efficiently.\nCommunications and Information Management\nCommunications and Information Management describes systems and\nmethods that help to ensure that incident personnel and other decision makers\nhave the means and information they need to make and communicate\nNote\ndecisions.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-19\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nNIMS Management Characteristics\nThe following video will introduce the NIMS Management Characteristics\ndiscussed in detail in this unit.\nVideo Duration: 2 minutes, 30 seconds\nVideo\nNIMS Management Characteristics: Overview\nVideo Transcript\nAs you learned in the previous lesson, ICS is based on proven NIMS management principles,\nwhich contribute to the strength and efficiency of the overall system.\nICS incorporates a wide range of management features and principles, beginning with the use of\ncommon terminology.\n[David Burns, Emergency Preparedness Manager, University of California Los Angeles]\nCommunication is probably one of the most essential elements of ICS. It’s important that we\nknow how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River Authority] If the\nterms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to have a hard time\ncommunicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our mission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an\nIncident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your end\nobjective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So you can\nestablish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan, and you can ensure\nthat they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established under a\nsingle Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management Office]\nOne of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the same\nframework.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-20\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nICS helps ensure full utilization of all incident resources by:\n• Maintaining a manageable span of control\n• Establishing designated incident facilities and locations\n• Implementing comprehensive resource management practices\n• Defining clear processes for dispatch/ deployment of resources\n• Ensuring integrated communications\nICS supports responders and decision makers through effective information and intelligence\nmanagement.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] The common operating\npicture is a critical thing that the Coast Guard has been working hard on recently for ourselves\nbecause it’s something that helps us maintain a better operational picture and it’s more consistent\nacross the board, everyone up and down the chain of command and across to other agencies\nunderstand the same picture.\nICS counts on each of us taking personal accountability for our own actions. And finally, the\nmobilization process helps ensure that incident objectives can be achieved while responders\nremain safe.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] To have NIMS work\neffectively, it’s got to be top-down support.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics covered in this lesson form the basis for effective, team-\nbased incident response under the Incident Command System (ICS).\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-21\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 17: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nThis course builds on what you learned in ICS 100 about NIMS Management Characteristics.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics are listed below.\n• Integrated Communications\n• Common Terminology\n• Establishment and Transfer of\n• Modular Organization\nCommand\n• Management by Objectives\n• Unified Command\n• Incident Action Planning\n• Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Manageable Span of Control\nCommand\n• Incident Facilities and Locations\n• Accountability\n• Comprehensive Resource Management\n• Dispatch/Deployment\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-22\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nActivity 1.1\nActivity Purpose: To see how much you remember from ICS-100 about NIMS Management\nCharacteristics.\nTime: 35 minutes\nInstructions:\n• Divide into table teams.\n• Instructions:\n• Your team will have 3 minutes to try to list as many NIMS Management\nCharacteristics as you can remember.

This is called\nManagement by Objectives.\nUnder ICS the Incident Commander (or Unified Command) establishes incident objectives.\nManagement by objectives includes:\n• Establishing specific, measurable objectives\n• Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks, and activities to achieve the objectives\n• Developing and issuing assignments, plans, procedures and protocols to accomplish tasks\n• Documenting results against objectives to measure performance, facilitate corrective\nactions, and inform development of objectives for the next operational period\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-24\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Action Planning\nIncident action planning guides incident management activities.\nAction Plans:\n• Record and communicate incident objectives, tactics, and assignments for operations and\nsupport\n• Are recommended for all incidents\n• Are not always written, but a written IAP is increasingly important when an incident or\nactivation:\n• Is likely to extend beyond one operational period\n• Becomes more complex\n• Involves multiple jurisdictions or agencies\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Manageable Span of Control\nSpan of control refers to the number of subordinates that directly report to a supervisor.\nMaintaining an appropriate span of control ensures effective incident management by enabling\nsupervisors to:\n• Direct and supervise subordinates\n• Communicate with and manage resources\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, the 1:5 ratio is only a guideline and effective incident management often calls for\ndifferent ratios.\nWhen a supervisor’s span of control becomes unmanageable, they can assign subordinate\nsupervisors or redistribute subordinates to manage portions of the organization in order to regain\na manageable span of control.\nSpan of control can change based on:\n• Type of incident\n• Nature of the task\n• Existing hazards and safety factors\n• Distances between personnel and resources\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Facilities and Locations\nThe Incident Commander, Unified Command or EOC director establishes incident support\nfacilities for specific purposes.\nThese facilities are identified and located based on the requirements of the situation.\nIncident size and complexity will influence the designation of facilities and locations.\nTypical designated facilities include:\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-25\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\n• Incident Command Post (ICP)\n• Incident base\n• Staging Areas\n• Camps\n• Mass casualty triage areas\n• Points-of-distribution\n• Emergency shelters\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Comprehensive Resource\nManagement\nMaintaining accurate and up-to-date inventories of resources is an essential component of\nincident management.\nResources include personnel, equipment, teams, supplies, and facilities available or potentially\navailable for assignment or allocation.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Integrated Communications\nIntegrated communications allow units from diverse agencies to connect, share information and\nachieve situational awareness.\nIncident managers facilitate communications through the development and use of:\n• A common communications plan\n• Interoperable communications processes and systems\n• Systems that include both voice and data links\nIntegrated Communications Planning occurs both before and during an incident to provide\nequipment, systems, and protocols needed to achieve integrated voice and data communications.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand\nWhen an incident is anticipated or occurs the organization with primary responsibility for the\nincident establishes command by designating the Incident Commander (IC) or Unified\nCommand (UC). Command may need to be transferred to a different IC/UC one or more times\nover the course of a long duration or increasingly complex incident.\nThe current command determines the protocol for transferring command. This transfer process\nshould always include a briefing for the incoming IC/UC on all essential information for\ncontinuing safe and effective operations. The transfer of command should also be communicated\nto all incident personnel.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-26\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Unified Command\nIn some incidents the Incident Command function is performed by a Unified Command (UC).\nUC is typically used for incidents involving:\n• Multiple jurisdictions\n• A single jurisdiction with multiagency involvement\n• Multiple jurisdictions with multiagency involvement\nUC allows agencies with different authorities and responsibilities to work together effectively\nwithout affecting individual agency authority, responsibility, or accountability.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Chain of Command and Unity\nof Command\nChain of command refers to the orderly command hierarchy within an incident management\norganization.\nUnity of command means that each individual reports to only one designated supervisor.\nThese principles:\n• Clarify reporting relationships\n• Eliminate confusion caused by conflicting instructions\n• Enable incident managers at all levels to direct the actions of all personnel under their\nsupervision\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Accountability\nAccountability for all resources during an incident is essential.\nIncident management personnel should adhere to principles of accountability, including:\n• Check-in/checkout\n• Incident action planning\n• Unity of command\n• Personal responsibility\n• Span of control\n• Resource tracking\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Dispatch/Deployment\nResources should deploy only when requested and dispatched through established procedures by\nappropriate authorities.\nResources that authorities do not request should not deploy spontaneously - unrequested\nresources can overburden the IC/UC and increase accountability challenges.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-27\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nIncident-related information and intelligence is managed by the incident management\norganization through established processes for:\n• Gathering\n• Analyzing\n• Assessing\n• Sharing\n• Managing\nInformation and intelligence management includes identifying essential elements of information\n(EEI). EEI ensures incident personnel gather the most accurate and appropriate data, translate it\ninto useful information, and communicate it with appropriate personnel.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-28\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 19: Additional Resources\nFor more information, consult the following resources:\nVisit this website to review the National Incident Management System (NIMS) -\nhttps://www.fema.gov/national-incident-management-system\n• Visit this website to review HSPD-5 in its entirety -\nhttps://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/assets/hspd-5.pdf\nVisit this website to review PPD-8 in its entirety - https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-\ndirective-8-national-preparedness\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-29\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 20: Lesson Summary\nYou have completed the Course Overview lesson.

Incident managers at\nall levels must be able to control the actions of all personnel\nunder their supervision.\nUnity of command clears up many of the potential\ncommunication problems encountered in managing incidents or\nevents because each individual maintains a formal\ncommunication relationship only with his or her immediate\nsupervisor.\nDon't confuse unity of command with Unified Command!\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-34\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Unified Command (1 of 2)\nWhen no one jurisdiction, agency, or\norganization has primary authority and/or the\nresources to manage an incident on its own,\nUnified Command may be established. There is\nno one \"Commander.\" The Unified Command\ncan allocate resources regardless of ownership or\nlocation.\nThis illustration shows three responsible\nagencies managing an incident together under a\nUnified Command.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-35\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Unified Command (2 of 2)\nUnified Command:\n• Enables all responsible agencies to manage\nan incident together by establishing a\ncommon set of incident objectives and\nstrategies\n• Allows Incident Commanders to make joint\ndecisions by establishing a single command\nstructure at one Incident Command Post\n(ICP)\n• Maintains Unity of Command.

Read the scenario in your Student Manual.\n2. Identify the potential incident management issues.\n3. List the incident management issues on chart paper.\n4. Choose a spokesperson. Be prepared to present your findings to the class in 10 minutes.\nScenario:\nA tornado collapsed a building, trapping 15 people in its basement. Fire department officers\nimmediately designated a fire station located directly across from the incident site as the Incident\nCommand Post (ICP). However, the fire station’s confined location and immediate proximity to\nthe incident made it ill-suited for directing the large-scale response effort. As police officers\narrived on the scene, they decided to establish their Command Center at a school, several blocks\naway from the immediate response activities.\nAs response operations progressed and a mobile command vehicle became available, the\nIncident Command Post (ICP) was established in that vehicle just north of the hospital. Other\nagencies involved, such as the fire department and emergency medical services, began operating\nnear the new ICP location and Incident Commander.

The IC has overall\nNote\nauthority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is\nresponsible for the management of all incident operations at the\nincident site.\n• Command Staff: The Command Staff consists of:\n• Liaison Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible\nfor coordinating with representatives from cooperating and\nassisting agencies. The Liaison Officer may have Assistants.\n• Public Information Officer: A member of the Command Staff\nresponsible for interfacing with the public and media or with\nother agencies with incident-related information requirements.\n• Safety Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible for\nmonitoring and assessing safety hazards or unsafe situations, and\nfor developing measures for ensuring personnel safety. The Safety\nOfficer may have Assistants.\n• General Staff: The organization level having functional\nresponsibility for primary segments of incident management\n(Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance/Administration). The\nSection level is organizationally between Branch and Incident\nCommander. Sections are as follows:\n• Operations Section: The Operations Section responsible for all\ntactical operations at the incident. The Operations Section\nincludes:\n Branch: That organizational level having functional,\ngeographical, or jurisdictional responsibility for major\nparts of the incident operations. The Branch level is\norganizationally between Section and Division/Group\nin the Operations Section, and between Section and\nUnits in the Logistics Section. Branches are identified\nby the use of Roman numerals, by function, or by\njurisdictional name.\n Division: That organization level having responsibility\nfor operations within a defined geographic area. The\nDivision level is organizationally between the Strike\nTeam and the Branch.\n Group: Groups are established to divide the incident\ninto functional areas of operation. Groups are located\nbetween Branches (when activated) and Resources in\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-62\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nthe Operations Section.\n Unit: That organization element having functional\nresponsibility for a specific incident planning,\nlogistics, or finance activity.\n Task Force: A group of resources with common\ncommunications and a leader that may be\npreestablished and sent to an incident or formed at an\nincident.\n Strike Team/Resource Team: Specified\ncombinations of the same kind and type of resources,\nwith common communications and a leader.\n Single Resource: An individual, a piece of equipment\nand its personnel complement, or an established crew\nor team of individuals with an identified work\nsupervisor, that can be used on an incident.\n• Planning Section: Responsible for the collection, evaluation, and\ndissemination of information related to the incident, and for the\npreparation and documentation of the Incident Action Plan. The\nPlanning Section also maintains information on the current and\nforecasted situation, and on the status of resources assigned to the\nincident. This Section includes the Situation, Resources,\nDocumentation, and Demobilization Units, as well as Technical\nSpecialists.\n• Logistics Section: The Section responsible for providing\nfacilities, services, and materials for the incident. Includes the\nService Branch (Communications Unit, Medical Unit, and Food\nUnit) and Support Branch (Supply Unit, Facilities Unit, and\nGround Support Unit).\n• Finance/Administration Section: The Section responsible for all\nincident costs and financial considerations. The\nFinance/Administration Section includes the Time Unit,\nProcurement Unit, Compensation/Claims Unit, and Cost Unit.\n• Intelligence/Investigations (I/I) Function: Some incidents\ninvolve intensive intelligence gathering and investigative activity,\nand for such incidents, the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand may reconfigure intelligence and investigations\nresponsibilities to meet the needs of the incident. The purpose of\nthe Intelligence/Investigations function is to ensure that\nintelligence and investigative operations and activities are\nproperly managed and coordinated.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-63\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: NIMS Management: Manageable Span of\nControl\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, effective incident management frequently necessitates ratios significantly different\nfrom this. The 1:5 ratio is a guideline, and incident personnel use their best judgment to\ndetermine the actual distribution of subordinates to supervisors for a given incident or EOC\nactivation.\nSpan of control is key to effective and efficient incident management.\nMaintaining an effective span of control is important because safety and\naccountability are a priority.\nNote\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-64\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Span of Control\nWhat influences span of control?\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-65\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Modular Organization\nThe ICS organization adheres to a \"form\nfollows function\" philosophy. The size of the\ncurrent organization and that of the next\noperational period is determined through the\nincident planning process.\nBecause the ICS is a modular concept,\nmanaging span of control is accomplished by\norganizing resources into Teams, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections. When the\nsupervisor-to-subordinate ratio exceeds\nmanageable span of control, additional Teams,\nDivisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections can\nbe established. When a supervisor is managing\ntoo few subordinates, Sections, Branches,\nDivisions, Groups, or Teams can be\nreorganized or demobilized to reach a more\neffective span of control.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-66\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Typical Organizational Structure\nThe initial response to most domestic incidents is\ntypically handled by local \"911\" dispatch centers,\nemergency responders within a single jurisdiction, and\ndirect supporters of emergency responders. Most\nresponses need go no further.\nApproximately 95% of all incidents are small\nresponses that include:\n• Command: Incident Commander and other\nCommand Staff\n• Single Resource: An individual, a piece of\nequipment and its personnel complement, or\nan established crew or team of individuals with\nan identified work supervisor that can be used\non an incident\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-67\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Expanding Incidents\nIncidents that begin with single resources may rapidly expand requiring significant additional\nresources and operational support.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-68\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Use of Position Titles\nAt each level within the ICS organization, individuals\nwith primary responsibility positions have distinct\ntitles.

Deputies\nmay be assigned at the Incident Command, Section, or Branch levels.\nThe only ICS requirement regarding the use of a Deputy is that the\nDeputy must be fully qualified and equally capable to assume the\nposition.\nThe three primary reasons to designate a Deputy Incident Commander\nare to:\n• Perform specific tasks as requested by the Incident\nCommander.\n• Perform the incident command function in a relief capacity\n(e.g., to take over for the next operational period). In this case,\nthe Deputy will assume the primary role.\n• Represent an Assisting Agency that may share jurisdiction or\nhave jurisdiction in the future.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-112\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Command Staff\nThe Command Staff is only activated in response\nto the needs of the incident. If a Command Staff\nposition is not needed it will not be activated. For\nexample, an incident may not require a Liaison\nOfficer if there are not outside agencies or\norganizations to coordinate with.\nCommand Staff includes the following positions:\n• Public Information Officer\n• Liaison Officer\n• Safety Officer\nCommand Staff Functions\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command assigns Command Staff as\nneeded to support the command function. The Command Staff typically\nincludes a Public Information Officer (PIO), a Safety Officer, and a Liaison\nNote\nOfficer who report directly to the Incident Commander or Unified Command\nand have assistants as necessary.

The PIO gathers,\nverifies, coordinates, and disseminates\naccessible,15 meaningful, and timely\ninformation on the incident for both internal\nand external audiences. The PIO also monitors\nthe media and other sources of public\ninformation to collect relevant information and\ntransmits this information to the appropriate\ncomponents of the incident management\norganization. In incidents that involve PIOs\nfrom different agencies, the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command designates\none as the lead PIO. All PIOs should work in a\nunified manner, speaking with one voice, and\nensure that all messaging is consistent. The\nIncident Commander or Unified Command\napproves the release of incident-related\ninformation. In large-scale incidents, the PIO\nparticipates in or leads the Joint Information\nCenter (JIC).\nSafety Officer The Safety Officer monitors incident\noperations and advises the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command on matters\nrelating to the health and safety of incident\npersonnel. Ultimate responsibility for the safe\nconduct of incident management rests with the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command and\nsupervisors at all levels. The Safety Officer is\nresponsible to the Incident Commander or\nUnified Command for establishing the systems\nand procedures necessary to assess,\ncommunicate, and mitigate hazardous\nenvironments. This includes developing and\nmaintaining the incident Safety Plan,\ncoordinating multiagency safety efforts, and\nimplementing measures to promote the safety\nof incident personnel and incident sites. The\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-117\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nCommand Staff Responsibilities\nSafety Officer stops and/or prevents unsafe\nacts during the incident. Agencies,\norganizations, or jurisdictions that contribute to\njoint safety management efforts do not lose\ntheir individual responsibilities or authorities\nfor their own programs, policies, and\npersonnel. Rather, each contributes to the\noverall effort to protect all personnel involved\nin the incident.\nLiaison Officer The Liaison Officer is the incident command’s\npoint of contact for representatives of\ngovernmental agencies, jurisdictions, NGOs,\nand private sector organizations that are not\nincluded in the Unified Command. Through\nthe Liaison Officer, these representatives\nprovide input on their agency, organization, or\njurisdiction’s policies, resource availability,\nand other incident-related matters. Under either\na single Incident Commander or a Unified\nCommand structure, representatives from\nassisting or cooperating jurisdictions and\norganizations coordinate through the Liaison\nOfficer. The Liaison Officer may have\nassistants.\nSource: National Incident Management System (NIMS)\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-118\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Assistants\nIn a large or complex incident, Command Staff members may\nneed one or more Assistants to help manage their workloads.\nEach Command Staff member is responsible for organizing his\nor her Assistants for maximum efficiency. Assistants are\nsubordinates of principal Command Staff positions.\nAs the title indicates, Assistants should have a level of technical\ncapability, qualifications, and responsibility subordinate to the\nprimary positions.\nAssistants may also be assigned to Unit Leaders (e.g., at camps\nto supervise unit activities).\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-119\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Discussion Question\nScenario: On July 18, 2001, a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed and caught fire in a\ndowntown Baltimore tunnel, causing a near shutdown of the city and burning so hot that\nfirefighters couldn't reach the flames for 8 hours.\nAt one point, all major highways into the city were blocked off, a Baltimore Orioles game at\nnearby Camden Yards was canceled, and the Inner Harbor was closed to boat traffic.

As the incident\ngrows in scope and the number of resources needed increases,\nthere may be a need to activate Teams, Units, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections to maintain an appropriate span\nof control. The optimal span of control for incident\nmanagement is one supervisor to five subordinates; however,\neffective incident management may require ratios different from\nthis. The 1:5 ratio is just a guideline.\nThe ability to delegate the supervision of resources not only\nfrees up the Incident Commander to perform critical decision-\nmaking and evaluation duties, but also clearly defines the lines\nof communication to everyone involved in the incident.\nNext, we'll review the major organizational elements that may\nbe activated during an expanding incident.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-124\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Operations Section\nThe Operations Section:\n• Directs and coordinates all incident tactical\noperations\n• Is typically one of the first organizations to be\nassigned to the incident\n• Expands from the bottom up\n• Has the most incident resources\n• May have Staging Areas and special\norganizations\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-125\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: Operations Section Chief\nThe Operations Section Chief:\n• Is responsible to the Incident Commander for\nthe direct management of all incident-related\noperational activities\n• Establishes tactical objectives for each\noperational period\n• Has direct involvement in the preparation of\nthe Incident Action Plan\nThe Operations Section Chief may have one or more\nDeputies assigned.

Out-of-service resources are NOT located at the\nStaging Area.\nAfter a Staging Area has been designated and named, a Staging\nArea Manager will be assigned. The Staging Area Manager will\nreport to the Operations Section Chief or to the Incident\nCommander if the Operations Section Chief has not been\ndesignated.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-127\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: Staging Areas: Chain of Command\nThe graphic below shows where the Staging Area Manager fits into the Operations Section.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-128\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 19: Divisions and Groups\nDivisions are established to divide an incident into physical or geographical areas of operation.\nGroups are established to divide the incident into functional areas of operation.\nFor example, a Damage Assessment Task Force, reporting to the Infrastructure Group\nSupervisor, could work across divisions established to manage two distinct areas of the building\nthat have been damaged — the west side of the building (West Division) and the north side\n(North Division).\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-129\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 20: Branches\nBranches may be used to serve several purposes and may be functional or geographic in\nnature.

In addition to these\nIAP related meetings, there will also be other\nmeetings and briefings within the ICS\norganization to include section-level meetings\nand briefings, situation update briefings, and\ntransfer of command briefings.\nOperational Period Planning Cycle\nInitial Response and Assessment\nNote\nThe responder(s) who is first to arrive at the incident scene conducts the\ninitial assessment and takes whatever immediate response actions are\nappropriate and possible. The initial or rapid assessment is essential to\ngaining and maintaining situational awareness. It enables the Incident\nCommander to request additional resources and/or support, develop, and\nimplement initial tactics. Jurisdiction officials might decide to activate an\nEOC based on the initial assessment.\nAgency Administrator Briefing\nThe Agency Administrator Briefing is a presentation to the personnel who\nwill be managing or supporting the incident by the administrator or other\nsenior official of the jurisdiction, agency, or organization affected by the\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-156\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nincident. This briefing occurs when the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand are assuming duties outside their normal responsibilities or are\nfrom an entity or jurisdictional area that does not possess authority to the\nmanage the incident they are being assigned. In such cases, the briefing\nprovides supporting details to the delegation of authority or other document\nthat the jurisdiction, agency, or organization typically provides to the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nDuring the briefing, the agency administrator or a designee provides\ninformation, guidance, and direction—including priorities and constraints—\nnecessary for the successful management of the incident. The briefing is\nintended to ensure a common understanding between the jurisdiction,\nagency, or organization and the incident personnel regarding such things as\nthe environmental, social, political, economic, and cultural issues relevant to\nthe incident and its location.\nIncident Briefing\nThe incident briefing marks the transition from reactive to proactive incident\nmanagement. The initial responder(s) typically delivers the briefing to the\nincoming Incident Commander or Unified Command. This meeting enables\nthe incoming Incident Commander or Unified Command to initiate planning\nfor the next operational period.\nInitial Unified Command Meeting\nIf a Unified Command is managing the incident, the Initial Unified\nCommand Meeting allows members of the Unified Command to meet in\nprivate to discuss each jurisdiction or organization’s priorities and objectives\nas well as any limitations, concerns, and restrictions. During the Initial\nUnified Command Meeting, members of the Unified Command generally\naccomplish the next step by developing the initial joint incident objectives.\nObjectives Development/Update\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command establishes the incident\nobjectives for the initial operational period. After the initial operational\nperiod, the Incident Commander or Unified Command reviews the incident\nobjectives and may validate them, modify them, or develop new objectives.\nIncident objectives are based on incident priorities and other requirements.\nClearly communicated priorities and objectives support unity of effort among\nincident personnel and enable the development of appropriate strategies and\ntactics. When the members of the team clearly understand the intent behind\ntheir instructions, they are better equipped to act decisively and make good\ndecisions.\nStrategy Meeting/Command and General Staff Meeting\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-157\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nAfter developing or revising the incident objectives, the Incident Commander\nor Unified Command typically meets with the Command and General Staff,\nand sometimes others, to discuss the incident objectives and provide\ndirection. This meeting may be called the Strategy Meeting or the Command\nand General Staff Meeting and is held as needed to determine how best to\nmeet the incident objectives.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting, which is held the first time through the planning\ncycle, is particularly important, because it allows team members to share\ninformation and jointly determine the initial approach to response operations.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting may include the initial Incident Commander and\na representative from the Agency Administrator.\nPreparing for the Tactics Meeting\nOnce the approach to achieving or working toward achieving the incident\nobjectives is determined, the Operations Section Chief and staff prepare for\nthe Tactics Meeting by developing tactics and determining the resources that\nwill be applied during the operational period.\nTactics Meeting\nThe Tactics Meeting is a forum for key players to review the proposed tactics\ndeveloped by the Operations Section staff and to conduct planning for\nresource assignments. The Operations Section Chief leads the Tactics\nMeeting, and key participants include the Logistics Section Chief, Safety\nOfficer, a representative from the Planning Section—typically, the Resources\nUnit Leader—and other technical specialists or team members invited by the\nOperations Section Chief, Logistics Section Chief, or Safety Officer. The\nteam uses ICS Forms 215 and 215A, the Operational Planning Worksheet\nand the Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis, to facilitate and document\ndecisions they make during the meeting.\nPreparing for the Planning Meeting\nFollowing the Tactics Meeting, preparations begin for the Planning Meeting.\nTeam members collaborate between the Tactics Meeting and the Planning\nMeeting to identify support needs and assign specific operational resources\nto accomplish the operational plan.\nPlanning Meeting\nThe Planning Meeting serves as a final review and approval of operational\nplans and resource assignments developed during and after the Tactics\nMeeting. Ideally, the Planning Meeting involves no surprises and simply\nserves as a review of a plan that the Command and General Staff have\ncollaboratively developed and agreed upon. At the end of the Planning\nMeeting, Command and General Staff, and any agency officials involved,\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-158\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nconfirm that they can support the plan.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-159\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Effective Meetings and Briefings\nEffective briefings and meetings are:\n• An essential element to good supervision and incident\nmanagement\n• Intended to pass along vital information required in the\ncompletion of incident response actions\nTypically, these briefings are concise and do not include long\ndiscussions or complex decision-making. Rather, they allow\nincident managers and supervisors to communicate specific\ninformation and expectations for the upcoming work period and\nto answer questions.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-160\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Levels of Briefings\nThere are three types of briefings/meetings used in ICS: staff\nlevel, field level, and section level.\n• Staff-level briefings are delivered to resources\nassigned to nonoperational and support tasks at the\nIncident Command Post or Base.\n• Field-level briefings are delivered to individual\nresources or crews who are assigned to operational\ntasks and/or work at or near the incident site.\n• Section-level briefings are delivered to an entire\nSection and include the Operational Period\nBriefing.\nBriefing Types\nStaff-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to nonoperational and\nNote support tasks that are commonly performed at the Incident Base or Command\nPost. These briefings will be delivered to individual staff members or full\nunits within a section. These briefings occur at the beginning of the\nassignment to the incident and as necessary during the assignment. The\nsupervisor attempts to clarify tasks and scope of the work as well as define\nreporting schedule, subordinate responsibilities and delegated authority, and\nthe supervisor's expectations. The supervisor will also introduce coworkers\nand define actual workspace, sources of work supplies, and work schedule.\nField-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to operational tasks and/or\nwork at or near the incident site. These briefings will be delivered to\nindividual subordinates, full crews, or multiple crews such as Strike Teams\nor Task Forces and will occur at the beginning of an operational shift. The\nlocation will usually be near the work site or just prior to mobilization to the\nfield. The supervisor attempts to focus the subordinates on their specific\ntasks and helps define work area, reporting relationships, and expectations.\nSection-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves the briefing of an entire Section (Operations,\nPlanning, Logistics, or Finance/Administration) and is done by the specific\nSection Chief. These briefings occur at the beginning of the assignment to\nthe incident and after the arrival of Section supervisory staff. The Section\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-161\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nChief may schedule periodic briefings at specific times (once per day) or\nwhen necessary. A unique briefing in this category is the Operational\nPeriod Briefing (also called a Shift Operations Briefing). Here, the\nOperations Section Chief presents the plan for all operational elements for\nthe specific operational period. This specific briefing is done at the beginning\nof each operation shift and prior to the operational resources being deployed\nto the area of work. Often, a field-level briefing will take place subsequent to\nthe completion of the Operational Period Briefing.\nDuring any section-level briefing, the supervisor attempts to share incident-\nwide direction from the Incident Commander (IC), how the direction impacts\nthe Section staff, and specific ways the Section will support the IC's\ndirection. The supervisor will establish Section staffing requirements,\nSection work tasks, Section-wide scheduling rules, and overall timelines for\nmeetings and completion of work products.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-162\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Activity 5.1: Briefing Information\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at determining the appropriate details required when\npreparing for an incident briefing and identifying information pertinent to the audience to\nbe covered in the briefing.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your group:\n1.

The ICS\norganization may be expanded easily from a very small size for\nroutine operations to a larger organization capable of handling\ncatastrophic events.\nStandardization within ICS does NOT limit flexibility. ICS\nworks for small, routine operations as well as catastrophic\nevents.\nFlexibility does NOT mean that the NIMS Management\nCharacteristic Common Terminology is superseded. Flexibility\nis exercised only within the standard ICS organizational\nstructure and position titles. Flexibility does not mean using\nnon-standard organizational structures or position titles that\nwould interfere with the NIMS Management Characteristics\nCommon Terminology and Modular Organization.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-176\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Modular Organization\nIncident command organizational structure is based on:\n• Size and complexity of the incident\n• Specifics of the hazard environment created by\nthe incident\n• Incident planning process and incident\nobjectives\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-177\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Discussion Question\nShould an incident's ICS organizational structure include all General and Command Staff\nfunctions and positions at all times?\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-178\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: ICS Expansion and Contraction\nAlthough there are no hard-and-fast rules, it is important to\nremember that:\n• Only functions and positions that are necessary to achieve\nincident objectives are filled.\n• Each activated element must have a person in charge.\n• An effective span of control must be maintained.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-179\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 6: Activation of Organizational Elements\nMany incidents will never require the activation of\nthe entire Command or General Staff or entire list of\norganizational elements within each Section. Other\nincidents will require some or all members of the\nCommand Staff and all sub-elements of each General\nStaff section.\nThe decision to activate an element (Section,\nBranch, Division, Group or Unit) must be based on\nincident objectives and resource needs.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-180\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Activation of Organizational Elements\n(Continued)\nAn important concept is that many organizational\nelements may be activated in various Sections without\nactivating the Section Chief.\nFor example, the Situation Unit can be activated without a\nPlanning Section Chief assigned. In this case, the\nsupervision of the Situation Unit will rest with the\nIncident Commander.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-181\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Discussion Question\nShould you combine ICS positions and titles in order to save on staffing or achieve a higher\nlevel of efficiency?\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-182\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Avoid Combining Positions\nIt is tempting to combine ICS positions to gain staffing efficiency. Rather than combining\npositions, you may assign the same individual to supervise multiple units.\nWhen assigning personnel to multiple positions, do not use nonstandard titles. Creating new\ntitles may be unrecognizable to assisting or cooperating personnel and may cause confusion.\nBe aware of potential span-of-control issues that may arise from assigning one person to\nmultiple positions.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-183\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Resource Management\nMaintaining an accurate and up-to-date picture of\nresource utilization is a critical component of\nincident management. The incident resource\nmanagement process consists of the following:\n• Identifying Requirements\n• Ordering and Acquiring\n• Mobilizing\n• Tracking and Reporting\n• Demobilizing\n• Reimbursing and Restocking\nThis section of the lesson reviews key resource\nmanagement principles.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-184\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Anticipating Incident Resource Needs\nExperience and training will help you to predict\nworkloads and corresponding staffing needs. As the\ngraphic illustrates, an incident may build faster than\nresources can arrive.\nEventually, a sufficient number of resources arrive\nand begin to control the incident. As the incident\ndeclines, resources then exceed incident needs.\nRemember that when resources increase or decrease\nyou will have to reassess your organizational\nstructure and staffing to determine if it is right-sized\nfor the resources that are being managed.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-185\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Predicting Incident Workload\nIncident workload patterns are often predictable throughout\nthe incident life cycle. Several examples are provided below:\n• Operations Section: The workload on Operations is\nimmediate and often massive. On a rapidly escalating\nincident, the Operations Section Chief must\ndetermine appropriate tactics; organize, assign, and\nsupervise resources; and at the same time participate\nin the planning process.\n• Planning Section: The Resources and Situation Units\nwill be very busy in the initial phases of the incident.\nIn the later stages, the workload of the\nDocumentation and Demobilization Units will\nincrease.\n• Logistics Section: The Supply and Communications\nUnits will be very active in the initial and final stages\nof the incident.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-186\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Analyzing Incident Complexity\nIt is important to strike the right balance when determining\nresource needs. Having too few resources can lead to loss of life\nand property, while having too many resources can result in\nunqualified personnel deployed without proper supervision.\nA complexity analysis can help:\n• Identify resource requirements\n• Determine if the existing management structure is\nappropriate\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-187\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 14: Complexity Analysis Factors\n• Community and responder safety\n• Impacts to life, property, and the economy\n• Potential hazardous materials\n• Weather and other environmental influences\n• Likelihood of cascading events\n• Potential crime scene (including terrorism)\n• Political sensitivity, external influences, and media relations\n• Area involved, jurisdictional boundaries\n• Availability of resources\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-188\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Activity 6.1: Complexity Analysis\nActivity Purpose: To give the students practice at identifying the indicators that are considered\nwhen analyzing and determining the complexity of an incident.\nTime: 20 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your team:\n1. Select an incident (e.g., flood, building collapse, water main break, bridge accident,\nhostage, hazardous materials, fire, disease outbreak, planned event, etc.).

Typing is done to ensure\nthat responders get the right personnel and\nequipment.\nICS resources are categorized by Capability,\nCategory, Kind, and Type.\n• Capability: The Core Capability for which a\nresource is most useful.\n• Category: The function for which a\nresource is most useful.\n• Kind: A description of what a resource is\n(personnel, teams, facilities, equipment or\nsupplies).\n• Type: The resource's minimum capability to\nperform its function. The level of capability\nis based on size, power and capacity (for\nequipment), or experience and qualifications\n(for personnel or teams).\nResource Typing Example\nExample:\nAn Ambulance Ground Team is in the Emergency Medical Services\nNote Category. It's Resource Kind is a Team. The definition of a Type 3\nAmbulance Ground Team includes a crew of 2 (an EMT 1 and an\nAmbulance Operator), with Basic Life Support (BLS) Capability, and the\ncapacity to transport 2 non-ambulatory patients.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-193\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: Discussion Question\nWhich is a kind?

A\nStrike Team may also be referred to as a\nResource Team by law enforcement.\n• A Single Resource is an individual, a piece of\nequipment and its personnel complement, or a\ncrew or team of individuals with an identified\nwork supervisor that can be used on an incident.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-198\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 23: Discussion Question\nWhich of these is Strike (Resource) Team? Task Force? Single Resource?\n• Five Type I ambulances and crew complements with a leader.\n• One Type I ambulance and crew complement.\n• One Type III Helicopter, one Urban Search & Rescue Team, and one Emergency\nMedical Technician with a leader.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-199\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 24: Incident Typing: Overview\nIncidents, like resources, may be categorized into five types based on\ncomplexity. Type 5 incidents are the least complex and Type 1 the most\ncomplex. Incident typing may be used to:\n• Make decisions about resource requirements.\n• Order Incident Management Teams (IMTs). An IMT is made up of\nthe Command and General Staff members in an ICS organization.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-200\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 25: Incident Typing: Overview (Continued)\nThe incident type corresponds to both the number of resources required and the anticipated\nincident duration. The incident types move from Type 5 being the least complex to Type 1\nbeing the most complex. As the number of resources required gets larger and the duration of\nthe incident gets longer, the complexity increases. The vast majority of incidents are in the\nType 3-5 range.\nClocks do not depict length of incident time.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-201\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 26: Type 5 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 5 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: One or two single resources with up to six\npersonnel. Command and General Staff positions (other\nthan the Incident Commander) are not activated.\n• Time Span: Incident is contained within the first\noperational period and often within a few hours after\nresources arrive on scene. No written Incident Action\nPlan is required.\nExamples include a vehicle fire, an injured person, or a police\ntraffic stop.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-202\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: Type 4 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 4 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: Command Staff and General\nStaff functions are activated (only if\nneeded). Several single resources are\nrequired to mitigate the incident.\n• Time Span: Limited to one operational\nperiod in the control phase. No written\nIncident Action Plan is required for non-\nHazMat incidents. A documented\noperational briefing is completed.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-203\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Type 3 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 3 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: When capabilities exceed initial response,\nthe appropriate ICS positions should be added to match\nthe complexity of the incident. Some or all of the\nCommand and General Staff positions may be activated,\nas well as Division or Group Supervisor and/or Unit\nLeader level positions. An Incident Management Team\n(IMT) or incident command organization manages initial\naction incidents with a significant number of resources,\nand an extended response incident until\ncontainment/control is achieved.\n• Time Span: The incident may extend into multiple\noperational periods and a written Incident Action Plan\nmay be required for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-204\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Type 2 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 2 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: Regional and/or national resources are\nrequired to safely and effectively manage the operations.\nMost or all Command and General Staff positions are\nfilled. Operations personnel typically do not exceed 200\nper operational period and the total does not exceed 500.\nThe agency administrator/official is responsible for the\nincident complexity analysis, agency administrator\nbriefings, and written delegation of authority.\n• Time Span: The incident is expected to go into multiple\noperational periods. A written Incident Action Plan is\nrequired for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-205\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Type 1 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 1 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: National resources are required to safely and\neffectively manage the operations. All Command and\nGeneral Staff positions are activated, and Branches need\nto be established. Operations personnel often exceed 500\nper operational period and total personnel will usually\nexceed 1,000. There is a high impact on the local\njurisdiction, requiring additional staff for office\nadministrative and support functions. The incident may\nresult in a disaster declaration.\n• Time Span: The incident is expected to go into multiple\noperational periods. A written Incident Action Plan is\nrequired for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-206\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Incident Management Teams (IMTs)\nIMTs are rostered groups of ICS-qualified personnel consisting\nof an Incident Commander, other incident leadership, and\npersonnel qualified for other key ICS positions. An IMT may be\nused to respond to an incident. IMTs include Command and\nGeneral Staff members. IMT types correspond to incident type\nand include:\n• Type 5: Local Village and Township Level\n• Type 4: City, County, or Fire District Level\n• Type 3: State, Territory, Tribal, or Metropolitan Area\nLevel\n• Type 2: National and State Level\n• Type 1: National and State Level (Type 1 Incident)\nTeam members are certified as having the necessary training\nand experience to fulfill IMT positions.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-207\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Activity 6.2: Incident Types\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at determining incident types for various scenarios.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team:\n1.

The vehicle stops when it\nruns into an exhibit hall next to the outdoor stage. A\nfew moments later, as the crowd begins to react, the\nlarge truck catches fire.\nSeveral people were injured as the tanker truck\npassed through the crowd and there could be deaths.\nThere is disorder as some attempt to flee and others\ntry to help.\nThe large truck is an active fire that must be\nsuppressed and could spread to nearby structures.\nThere are other potential hazards including a\ndamaged building and utilities (power, water, and\ngas) that could be damaged.\nPublic safety personnel on scene- law enforcement,\nfire, and EMS- respond immediately to the incident.\nBoth the Central City and Liberty County\nEmergency Operations Centers are notified of these\nevents and prepare to send any additional resources\nrequired for the incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-239\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Establish Command\nIt is now approximately 5:15 pm. You are the first\nsupervisor on scene and there is a need to quickly to\nestablish Incident Command.\nLet’s review a few of the NIMS Management\nCharacteristics that apply to determining the best\napproach for the Incident Command function in an\nincident:\n• Establishment and Transfer of Command - the\nfirst on scene need to explicitly establish incident\nor unified command and clearly state and record\nwhen command is transferred.\n• Chain of Command and Unity of Command -\nall responders must be under a single command\nstructure led by a designated Incident\nCommander (IC) or Unified Command (UC).\n• Unified Command - if multiple organizations,\ndisciplines, or jurisdictions are involved in the\nresponse, is a single IC sufficient, or is there a\nneed for a unified command? UC is normally\nused for incidents involving multiple\njurisdictions, a single jurisdiction with\nmultiagency involvement, or multiple\njurisdictions with multiagency involvement.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-240\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Activity 8.1: Establish Command\nActivity Purpose: To apply key concepts regarding establishing command.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .\n1.

This Incident Commander will be from\nthe Central City Fire Department. Other jurisdictions and\nagencies involved in response to this incident will take their\ndirection from this Incident Commander.\nThis conforms to the NIMS Management Characteristic of\nChain of Command and Unity of Command – all responders\nare under a single command structure led by an Incident\nCommander.\nRemember that the Incident Commander will manage the\nincident by establishing a common set of incident objectives\nfor all jurisdictions and agencies involved in this response.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-242\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: So, what is next?\nActing as the Incident Commander and determining your approach to the incident, your initial\nactions should include a Size-Up.\nA size-up is done to develop initial incident objectives. Incident objectives will define what\ntypes of resources are required to respond to the incident. Finally, the resources the Incident\nCommander will manage affect which Command and General Staff positions will be activated\nto assist the IC in management of the incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-243\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: So, what is next?

Additional resources\nwill be arriving soon and the Incident Commander\nwill need additional staff personnel to help in the\nmanagement in the incident response.\nEstablish an ICS Structure (Continued)\nThere are several NIMS Management Characteristics that can be applied to\ndetermining the appropriate ICS structure for an incident:\nNote • Chain of Command and Unity of Command: All resources should\nwork for a single general staff section and all general staff sections\nshould report to and receive direction from a single IC.\n• Manageable Span of Control: the ICS structure must be of a\nsufficient size to assist the IC in effectively managing the incident. A\nkey to this is constraining the number of subordinates or functions\nthat each supervisor manages.\n• Modular Organization: what pieces of the ICS structure are needed\nto manage the incident? Think ahead to the next operational period\nbecause what you need then often must be asked for now.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-264\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nWhat ICS Command and General Staff positions will you need\nto manage the incident?\nRemember that the Incident Commander/Unified Command is\nresponsible for performing all of these functions personally\nuntil he or she activates that function.\n• Incident Command\n• Public Information\n• Safety\n• Liaison\n• Operations\n• Planning\n• Logistics\n• Finance/Administration\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-265\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nWe previously assessed that this is a Type 4 Incident.\nWe expect several pieces of fire apparatus, ambulance crews, and\nlaw enforcement personnel to be involved. Between the incident site,\nthe staging area, and the perimeter we can assume that at least 30\nLaw Enforcement, Fire, and EMS personnel will be involved in the\nincident response. These personnel will be distributed across at six to\nten separate locations in and around the fairgrounds.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-266\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nFor the purposes of this activity, we will only look at the eight Command Staff and General Staff\npositions.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-267\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nRecall what function each Command and General Staff position performs:\n• Public Information Officer (PIO) interfaces with the public, media, and others needing\nincident information.\n• Safety Officer monitors incident operations and advises the Incident Command on\nmatters relating to health and safety.\n• Liaison Officer serves as the Incident Command’s point of contact for organizations not\nincluded in the Unified Command.\n• Operations Section plans and performs tactical activities to achieve the Incident\nObjectives established by the Incident Command.\n• Planning Section personnel collect, evaluate, and disseminate incident information to the\nIC/UC and other incident personnel.\n• Logistics Section personnel are responsible for providing services and support for the\nincident.\n• IC/UC establishes a Finance/Administration Section when the incident management\nactivities require on-scene or incident-specific finance and administrative support\nservices.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-268\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 33: Activity 8.6: Staff Selection Practice\nActivity Purpose: To allow students an opportunity to analyze the incident and select the\nappropriate staffing.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your team:\n1.

There are over a dozen injuries and at least\nthree dead.\nThe vehicle fire spread quickly to the building,\nigniting a damaged natural gas line in a kitchen area.\nThe combination of explosion, fire, and collision\ndamage caused the building to partially collapse. The\nfire continues to burn and now threatens other\nsurrounding structures.\nThe crowds are under control, but traffic has not yet\ncompletely cleared from the area and continues to\nslow the ingress and egress of emergency\nmanagement resources.\nThe vehicle driver has not been found and the origin\nand contents of the large truck have not been\nidentified. This raises new concerns that this could\nhave been an intentional act and that the truck could\nhave been transporting something hazardous.\nThis incident has increased in size and complexity\nand will extend into at least one more operational\nperiod.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-270\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 35: Activity 8.7: Expanding Incident\nActivity Purpose: To apply key concepts to analyze incidents.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .\n1.

It is\nalso possible that the increase in complexity will\nlead to the appointment of more senior personnel\nto Incident Command.\nRemember that Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand is a NIMS Management\nCharacteristic. You must clearly state and record\nwhen command is transferred.\nThe Transfer of Command should be conducted\nto create minimal disruption to the incident.\nWhenever possible, the Transfer of Command\nshould include a complete briefing on the\nsituation conducted face to face with the new\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristic Incident\nAction Planning also applies here. Incident\nobjectives, tactics, and assignments for\noperations and support should be recorded and\ncommunicated through an Incident Action Plan\n(IAP). As your incident increased in size,\ncomplexity, and length, you should have started\nto document incident response activities in a\nwritten plan.\nThe ICS Form 201 is a standard format to record\nkey situational information and document\nactions taken on an incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-272\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 37: Lesson Summary\nYou have completed the Application Activity.

After reviewing the summary information, you will receive\ninstructions for taking the course Final Exam.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-275\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 2: Lesson 1: Course Overview (NIMS & ICS\nReview)\n• NIMS provides the Nation with a standardized framework for incident management.\n• ICS, a part of NIMS, is a management system used to meet the demands of incidents\nlarge or small, planned or unplanned.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics:\n• Common Terminology • Integrated Communications\n• Modular Organization • Establishment and Transfer of\n• Management by Objectives Command\n• Incident Action Planning • Unified Command\n• Manageable Span of Control • Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Incident Facilities and Locations Command\n• Comprehensive Resource Management • Accountability\n• Dispatch/Deployment\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-276\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Lesson 2: Incident Command and Unified\nCommand\n• Chain of Command is the line of authority that flows down through the organizational\nstructure.\n• Unity of Command means that each individual will be assigned and report to only one\nsupervisor.\n• Unity of Command is different from Unified Command; Unified Command is established\nwhen no one jurisdiction, agency, or organization has primary authority, therefore there is\nno one clear Incident Commander. These multiple agencies work together to\ncommunicate and make command decisions.\n• Communication during an incident may be formal or informal\n• Formal communications must be used for work assignments, resource requests, and\nprogress reports.\n• Informal communication is used to exchange incident or event information only.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-277\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Lesson 2: Incident Command and Unified\nCommand\n• All levels of leadership on an incident should understand and practice the leadership\nprinciples, have a commitment to duty, and take actions that prioritize the safety of\npersonnel.\n• Clear communication is the responsibility of all responders in order to accomplish\nincident objectives. Incident Management Assessments may be conducted by leadership\nafter an incident to help personnel process what happened and why.\n• ICS utilizes a Modular Organization so that the organization can expand and contract as\nan incident grows and shrinks. This modular organization helps maintain an effective\nspan of control.\n• Manageable span of control with Modular Organization is accomplished by organizing\nresources into Teams, Divisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections. Leadership in each\norganizational level holds a unique title.\n• The flexibility allowed for in ICS does not override the importance of Common\nTerminology. Common Terminology must be used to maintain clear communication,\nwhether formal or informal.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-278\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• Authority is the right or obligation to act on behalf of a department, agency, or\njurisdiction.\n• The scope of authority that an Incident Commander has is determined by existing laws,\npolicies, and procedures. Additional authority may be delegated when necessary.\n• Delegation of authority is the process of granting authority to an individual or agency to\ncarry out specific functions during an incident.\n• Delegation of authority does NOT relieve the granting entity of the responsibility for that\nfunction. Authority can be delegated; responsibility cannot.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-279\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 6: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• When needed, a delegation of authority should contain elements related to restrictions,\nexternal implications and considerations, and planning and communication processes.\n• Authority is implemented by the Incident Commander through the management of\nobjectives. Effective Incident Objectives should be SMART. Objectives are not tactics or\nstrategies; they state what needs to be accomplished, not how to do it.\n• Objectives are a part of the Incident Action Plan, which is completed each operational\nperiod and outlines incident-specific information. It is created through a process known\nas the Operational Period Planning Cycle (Planning P).\n• Incident Command, as well as Command and General Staff, should also have a working\nknowledge of other preparedness plans, such as EOPs, SOGs, SOPs, and mutual aid\nagreements.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-280\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• The Incident Commander oversees the incident, sets incident objectives, and approves the\nIAP.\n• Command Staff include the Public Information Officer, Safety Officer, and Liaison\nOfficer.\n• The Incident Commander also oversees four sections of the ICS organizational structure:\nOperations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance & Administration. Each of these sections is\nresponsible for a different function during an incident; Sections are led by the General\nStaff who report to the Incident Commander. General Staff are titled as Section Chiefs.\n• Operations directs and coordinates all incident tactical operations.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-281\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• Planning maintains resource and situation status, prepares the IAP and other documents,\nand looks beyond the current operational period to anticipate potential future problems or\nevents.\n• Logistics is responsible for all support requirements, including communications, facility\nsupplies, medical needs, and food and drink for incident personnel.\n• Finance/Administration provides administrative and financial support services. This\nincludes handling claims related to property damage, injuries, and fatalities.\n• ICS Forms help communicate and organize information between Command, Command\nStaff, General Staff, and other incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-282\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Lesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Different meetings and briefings are used during the Incident Action Planning Process to\nshare information.\n• Briefings should be concise and may occur at the staff, field, or section level.\n• Information shared during a briefing includes the current situation and objectives, safety\nissues and emergency procedures, work tasks, facilities and work areas, communication\nprotocols, expectations, resource acquisition procedures, work schedules, and questions\nor concerns.\n• The Operational Period Briefing is led by the Incident Commander to present the IAP.\nCommand and General Staff will also participate to share important information.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-283\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Lesson 6: Organizational Flexibility\n• NIMS requires organizational standardization use of Common Terminology; however,\nICS is still flexible due to its Modular Organization.\n• Functions and positions within the organizational structure are activated and filled based\non the needs and demand of an incident. The ICS organizational structure will expand\nand contract with the incident.\n• Personnel may hold multiple titles within an incident's organizational structure, but the\ntitles must keep consistent with NIMS titles. Titles may not be shortened or combined.\n• Proper Resource Management is essential to maintaining an accurate and up-to-date\npicture of resource utilization and needs.\n• Incidents are typed based on size and complexity. Incident types move from Type 5 as\nthe least complex to Type 1 as the most complex.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-284\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Lesson 7: Transfer of Command\n• Transfer of Command is the process of moving the responsibility for incident command\nfrom one Incident Commander to another Incident Commander or Unified Command.\n• Transfer of Command should take place face-to-face when possible and include a\ncomplete briefing that captures essential information.\n• The transfer of command briefing should include elements such as the situation status,\nincident objectives and priorities, current organization, resource information, incident\ncommunications plan, etc.\n• A notification of the time and date that the transfer of command becomes effective should\nbe communicated to all incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-285\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Congratulations!\nYou should now be able to demonstrate knowledge of how to manage an initial response to an\nincident.\nThe course specifically discussed:\n• Incident Command and Unified Command\n• Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives\n• Functional Areas & Positions\n• Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Organizational Flexibility\n• Transfer of Command\n• Application of ICS for Initial Response\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-286\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: IS-200.c Final Exam Instructions\nWhen the review is completed, follow these Final Exam instructions:\n1.

It’s important that we\nknow how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River Authority] If the\nterms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to have a hard time\ncommunicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our mission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an\nIncident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your end\nobjective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So you can\nestablish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan, and you can ensure\nthat they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established under a\nsingle Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management Office]\nOne of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the same\nframework.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-20"

The initial or rapid assessment is essential to\ngaining and maintaining situational awareness. It enables the Incident\nCommander to request additional resources and/or support, develop, and\nimplement initial tactics.

This briefing occurs when the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand are assuming duties outside their normal responsibilities or are\nfrom an entity or jurisdictional area that does not possess authority to the\nmanage the incident they are being assigned. In such cases, the briefing\nprovides supporting details to the delegation of authority or other document\nthat the jurisdiction, agency, or organization typically provides to the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nDuring the briefing, the agency administrator or a designee provides\ninformation, guidance, and direction—including priorities and constraints—\nnecessary for the successful management of the incident. The briefing is\nintended to ensure a common understanding between the jurisdiction,\nagency, or organization and the incident personnel regarding such things as\nthe environmental, social, political, economic, and cultural issues relevant to\nthe incident and its location.\nIncident Briefing\nThe incident briefing marks the transition from reactive to proactive incident\nmanagement. The initial responder(s) typically delivers the briefing to the\nincoming Incident Commander or Unified Command. This meeting enables\nthe incoming Incident Commander or Unified Command to initiate planning\nfor the next operational period.\nInitial Unified Command Meeting\nIf a Unified Command is managing the incident, the Initial Unified\nCommand Meeting allows members of the Unified Command to meet in\nprivate to discuss each jurisdiction or organization’s priorities and objectives\nas well as any limitations, concerns, and restrictions. During the Initial\nUnified Command Meeting, members of the Unified Command generally\naccomplish the next step by developing the initial joint incident objectives.\nObjectives Development/Update\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command establishes the incident\nobjectives for the initial operational period. After the initial operational\nperiod, the Incident Commander or Unified Command reviews the incident\nobjectives and may validate them, modify them, or develop new objectives.\nIncident objectives are based on incident priorities and other requirements.\nClearly communicated priorities and objectives support unity of effort among\nincident personnel and enable the development of appropriate strategies and\ntactics. When the members of the team clearly understand the intent behind\ntheir instructions, they are better equipped to act decisively and make good\ndecisions.\nStrategy Meeting/Command and General Staff Meeting\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-157"

This meeting may be called the Strategy Meeting or the Command\nand General Staff Meeting and is held as needed to determine how best to\nmeet the incident objectives.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting, which is held the first time through the planning\ncycle, is particularly important, because it allows team members to share\ninformation and jointly determine the initial approach to response operations.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting may include the initial Incident Commander and\na representative from the Agency Administrator.\nPreparing for the Tactics Meeting\nOnce the approach to achieving or working toward achieving the incident\nobjectives is determined, the Operations Section Chief and staff prepare for\nthe Tactics Meeting by developing tactics and determining the resources that\nwill be applied during the operational period.\nTactics Meeting\nThe Tactics Meeting is a forum for key players to review the proposed tactics\ndeveloped by the Operations Section staff and to conduct planning for\nresource assignments. The Operations Section Chief leads the Tactics\nMeeting, and key participants include the Logistics Section Chief, Safety\nOfficer, a representative from the Planning Section—typically, the Resources\nUnit Leader—and other technical specialists or team members invited by the\nOperations Section Chief, Logistics Section Chief, or Safety Officer. The\nteam uses ICS Forms 215 and 215A, the Operational Planning Worksheet\nand the Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis, to facilitate and document\ndecisions they make during the meeting.\nPreparing for the Planning Meeting\nFollowing the Tactics Meeting, preparations begin for the Planning Meeting.\nTeam members collaborate between the Tactics Meeting and the Planning\nMeeting to identify support needs and assign specific operational resources\nto accomplish the operational plan.\nPlanning Meeting\nThe Planning Meeting serves as a final review and approval of operational\nplans and resource assignments developed during and after the Tactics\nMeeting. Ideally, the Planning Meeting involves no surprises and simply\nserves as a review of a plan that the Command and General Staff have\ncollaboratively developed and agreed upon.

These briefings will be delivered to individual staff members or full\nunits within a section. These briefings occur at the beginning of the\nassignment to the incident and as necessary during the assignment. The\nsupervisor attempts to clarify tasks and scope of the work as well as define\nreporting schedule, subordinate responsibilities and delegated authority, and\nthe supervisor's expectations. The supervisor will also introduce coworkers\nand define actual workspace, sources of work supplies, and work schedule.\nField-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to operational tasks and/or\nwork at or near the incident site. These briefings will be delivered to\nindividual subordinates, full crews, or multiple crews such as Strike Teams\nor Task Forces and will occur at the beginning of an operational shift. The\nlocation will usually be near the work site or just prior to mobilization to the\nfield. The supervisor attempts to focus the subordinates on their specific\ntasks and helps define work area, reporting relationships, and expectations.\nSection-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves the briefing of an entire Section (Operations,\nPlanning, Logistics, or Finance/Administration) and is done by the specific\nSection Chief.

Actions to implement the use of NIMS take place at\ntwo levels - policy and organizational/operational.\nAt the policy level, implementing NIMS means government officials, i.e.,\ngovernors, mayors, county and city managers, tribal leaders, and others:\n• Adopt the NIMS through executive order, proclamation, or legislation\nas the jurisdiction's official incident response system; and\n• Direct that incident managers and response organizations in their\njurisdictions train, exercise, and use the NIMS in their response\noperations.\nAt the organizational/operational level, evidence that incident managers and\nemergency response organizations are implementing NIMS would include\nthe following:\n• NIMS is being integrated into functional and system-wide emergency\noperations policies, plans, and procedures.\n• NIMS training is planned or under way for responders, supervisors,\nand command level officers; and\n• Incident personnel at all levels are participating and/or coordinating\nexercises involving NIMS structures and responders from multiple\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-17\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\ndisciplines and jurisdictions.\nThe NIMS doctrine can be found at: www.fema.gov/national-incident-\nmanagement-system\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-18\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Major Components of NIMS\nJurisdictions and organizations involved in the management\nof incidents vary in their authorities, management\nstructures, communication capabilities and protocols, and\nmany other factors.\nThe major components of NIMS provide a common\nframework to integrate these diverse capabilities and\nachieve common goals.\nThe application of all three components is vital to\nsuccessful NIMS implementation.\nResource Management\nResource Management describes standard mechanisms to systematically\nmanage resources, including personnel, equipment, supplies, teams, and\nfacilities, both before and during incidents in order to allow organizations to\nNote\nmore effectively share resources when needed.\nCommand and Coordination\nCommand and Coordination describes leadership roles, processes, and\nrecommended organizational structures for incident management at the\noperational and incident support levels and explains how these structures\nNote\ninteract to manage incidents effectively and efficiently.\nCommunications and Information Management\nCommunications and Information Management describes systems and\nmethods that help to ensure that incident personnel and other decision makers\nhave the means and information they need to make and communicate\nNote\ndecisions.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-19\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nNIMS Management Characteristics\nThe following video will introduce the NIMS Management Characteristics\ndiscussed in detail in this unit.\nVideo Duration: 2 minutes, 30 seconds\nVideo\nNIMS Management Characteristics: Overview\nVideo Transcript\nAs you learned in the previous lesson, ICS is based on proven NIMS management principles,\nwhich contribute to the strength and efficiency of the overall system.\nICS incorporates a wide range of management features and principles, beginning with the use of\ncommon terminology.\n[David Burns, Emergency Preparedness Manager, University of California Los Angeles]\nCommunication is probably one of the most essential elements of ICS. It’s important that we\nknow how to communicate.\n[Daryl Lee Spiewak, Former Emergency Programs Manager, the Brazos River Authority] If the\nterms that I use mean different things to different people, we’re going to have a hard time\ncommunicating and doing what needs to be done to accomplish our mission.\nICS emphasizes effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an\nIncident Action Plan.\n[Roberta Runge, EPA National NIMS Coordinator] You have to coordinate on what your end\nobjective is. All up and down the chain you have to have a common end goal. So you can\nestablish your objectives, you can ensure they’re in the Incident Action Plan, and you can ensure\nthat they are in agreement.\nICS employs a modular organizational structure that can be tailored based on the size,\ncomplexity and hazards of an incident. Command of this organization is established under a\nsingle Incident Commander or a Unified Command.\nThe ICS features related to command structure include chain of command and unity of\ncommand.\n[Bill Campbell, Former Director of Training, New York State Emergency Management Office]\nOne of the benefits is it gets all of the different organizations working under the same\nframework.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-20\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nICS helps ensure full utilization of all incident resources by:\n• Maintaining a manageable span of control\n• Establishing designated incident facilities and locations\n• Implementing comprehensive resource management practices\n• Defining clear processes for dispatch/ deployment of resources\n• Ensuring integrated communications\nICS supports responders and decision makers through effective information and intelligence\nmanagement.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] The common operating\npicture is a critical thing that the Coast Guard has been working hard on recently for ourselves\nbecause it’s something that helps us maintain a better operational picture and it’s more consistent\nacross the board, everyone up and down the chain of command and across to other agencies\nunderstand the same picture.\nICS counts on each of us taking personal accountability for our own actions. And finally, the\nmobilization process helps ensure that incident objectives can be achieved while responders\nremain safe.\n[Kristy Plourde, Emergency Management Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard] To have NIMS work\neffectively, it’s got to be top-down support.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics covered in this lesson form the basis for effective, team-\nbased incident response under the Incident Command System (ICS).\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-21\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 17: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nOverview\nThis course builds on what you learned in ICS 100 about NIMS Management Characteristics.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics are listed below.\n• Integrated Communications\n• Common Terminology\n• Establishment and Transfer of\n• Modular Organization\nCommand\n• Management by Objectives\n• Unified Command\n• Incident Action Planning\n• Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Manageable Span of Control\nCommand\n• Incident Facilities and Locations\n• Accountability\n• Comprehensive Resource Management\n• Dispatch/Deployment\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-22\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: NIMS Management Characteristics:\nActivity 1.1\nActivity Purpose: To see how much you remember from ICS-100 about NIMS Management\nCharacteristics.\nTime: 35 minutes\nInstructions:\n• Divide into table teams.\n• Instructions:\n• Your team will have 3 minutes to try to list as many NIMS Management\nCharacteristics as you can remember.

This is called\nManagement by Objectives.\nUnder ICS the Incident Commander (or Unified Command) establishes incident objectives.\nManagement by objectives includes:\n• Establishing specific, measurable objectives\n• Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks, and activities to achieve the objectives\n• Developing and issuing assignments, plans, procedures and protocols to accomplish tasks\n• Documenting results against objectives to measure performance, facilitate corrective\nactions, and inform development of objectives for the next operational period\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-24\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Action Planning\nIncident action planning guides incident management activities.\nAction Plans:\n• Record and communicate incident objectives, tactics, and assignments for operations and\nsupport\n• Are recommended for all incidents\n• Are not always written, but a written IAP is increasingly important when an incident or\nactivation:\n• Is likely to extend beyond one operational period\n• Becomes more complex\n• Involves multiple jurisdictions or agencies\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Manageable Span of Control\nSpan of control refers to the number of subordinates that directly report to a supervisor.\nMaintaining an appropriate span of control ensures effective incident management by enabling\nsupervisors to:\n• Direct and supervise subordinates\n• Communicate with and manage resources\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, the 1:5 ratio is only a guideline and effective incident management often calls for\ndifferent ratios.\nWhen a supervisor’s span of control becomes unmanageable, they can assign subordinate\nsupervisors or redistribute subordinates to manage portions of the organization in order to regain\na manageable span of control.\nSpan of control can change based on:\n• Type of incident\n• Nature of the task\n• Existing hazards and safety factors\n• Distances between personnel and resources\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Incident Facilities and Locations\nThe Incident Commander, Unified Command or EOC director establishes incident support\nfacilities for specific purposes.\nThese facilities are identified and located based on the requirements of the situation.\nIncident size and complexity will influence the designation of facilities and locations.\nTypical designated facilities include:\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-25\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\n• Incident Command Post (ICP)\n• Incident base\n• Staging Areas\n• Camps\n• Mass casualty triage areas\n• Points-of-distribution\n• Emergency shelters\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Comprehensive Resource\nManagement\nMaintaining accurate and up-to-date inventories of resources is an essential component of\nincident management.\nResources include personnel, equipment, teams, supplies, and facilities available or potentially\navailable for assignment or allocation.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Integrated Communications\nIntegrated communications allow units from diverse agencies to connect, share information and\nachieve situational awareness.\nIncident managers facilitate communications through the development and use of:\n• A common communications plan\n• Interoperable communications processes and systems\n• Systems that include both voice and data links\nIntegrated Communications Planning occurs both before and during an incident to provide\nequipment, systems, and protocols needed to achieve integrated voice and data communications.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Establishment and Transfer of\nCommand\nWhen an incident is anticipated or occurs the organization with primary responsibility for the\nincident establishes command by designating the Incident Commander (IC) or Unified\nCommand (UC). Command may need to be transferred to a different IC/UC one or more times\nover the course of a long duration or increasingly complex incident.\nThe current command determines the protocol for transferring command. This transfer process\nshould always include a briefing for the incoming IC/UC on all essential information for\ncontinuing safe and effective operations. The transfer of command should also be communicated\nto all incident personnel.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-26\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Unified Command\nIn some incidents the Incident Command function is performed by a Unified Command (UC).\nUC is typically used for incidents involving:\n• Multiple jurisdictions\n• A single jurisdiction with multiagency involvement\n• Multiple jurisdictions with multiagency involvement\nUC allows agencies with different authorities and responsibilities to work together effectively\nwithout affecting individual agency authority, responsibility, or accountability.\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Chain of Command and Unity\nof Command\nChain of command refers to the orderly command hierarchy within an incident management\norganization.\nUnity of command means that each individual reports to only one designated supervisor.\nThese principles:\n• Clarify reporting relationships\n• Eliminate confusion caused by conflicting instructions\n• Enable incident managers at all levels to direct the actions of all personnel under their\nsupervision\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Accountability\nAccountability for all resources during an incident is essential.\nIncident management personnel should adhere to principles of accountability, including:\n• Check-in/checkout\n• Incident action planning\n• Unity of command\n• Personal responsibility\n• Span of control\n• Resource tracking\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Dispatch/Deployment\nResources should deploy only when requested and dispatched through established procedures by\nappropriate authorities.\nResources that authorities do not request should not deploy spontaneously - unrequested\nresources can overburden the IC/UC and increase accountability challenges.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-27\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nNIMS Management Characteristic: Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nIncident-related information and intelligence is managed by the incident management\norganization through established processes for:\n• Gathering\n• Analyzing\n• Assessing\n• Sharing\n• Managing\nInformation and intelligence management includes identifying essential elements of information\n(EEI). EEI ensures incident personnel gather the most accurate and appropriate data, translate it\ninto useful information, and communicate it with appropriate personnel.\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-28\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 19: Additional Resources\nFor more information, consult the following resources:\nVisit this website to review the National Incident Management System (NIMS) -\nhttps://www.fema.gov/national-incident-management-system\n• Visit this website to review HSPD-5 in its entirety -\nhttps://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/assets/hspd-5.pdf\nVisit this website to review PPD-8 in its entirety - https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-\ndirective-8-national-preparedness\nLesson 1: Course Overview SM-29\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 20: Lesson Summary\nYou have completed the Course Overview lesson.

Incident managers at\nall levels must be able to control the actions of all personnel\nunder their supervision.\nUnity of command clears up many of the potential\ncommunication problems encountered in managing incidents or\nevents because each individual maintains a formal\ncommunication relationship only with his or her immediate\nsupervisor.\nDon't confuse unity of command with Unified Command!\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-34\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Unified Command (1 of 2)\nWhen no one jurisdiction, agency, or\norganization has primary authority and/or the\nresources to manage an incident on its own,\nUnified Command may be established. There is\nno one \"Commander.\" The Unified Command\ncan allocate resources regardless of ownership or\nlocation.\nThis illustration shows three responsible\nagencies managing an incident together under a\nUnified Command.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-35\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Unified Command (2 of 2)\nUnified Command:\n• Enables all responsible agencies to manage\nan incident together by establishing a\ncommon set of incident objectives and\nstrategies\n• Allows Incident Commanders to make joint\ndecisions by establishing a single command\nstructure at one Incident Command Post\n(ICP)\n• Maintains Unity of Command.

The IC has overall\nNote\nauthority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is\nresponsible for the management of all incident operations at the\nincident site.\n• Command Staff: The Command Staff consists of:\n• Liaison Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible\nfor coordinating with representatives from cooperating and\nassisting agencies. The Liaison Officer may have Assistants.\n• Public Information Officer: A member of the Command Staff\nresponsible for interfacing with the public and media or with\nother agencies with incident-related information requirements.\n• Safety Officer: A member of the Command Staff responsible for\nmonitoring and assessing safety hazards or unsafe situations, and\nfor developing measures for ensuring personnel safety. The Safety\nOfficer may have Assistants.\n• General Staff: The organization level having functional\nresponsibility for primary segments of incident management\n(Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance/Administration). The\nSection level is organizationally between Branch and Incident\nCommander. Sections are as follows:\n• Operations Section: The Operations Section responsible for all\ntactical operations at the incident. The Operations Section\nincludes:\n Branch: That organizational level having functional,\ngeographical, or jurisdictional responsibility for major\nparts of the incident operations. The Branch level is\norganizationally between Section and Division/Group\nin the Operations Section, and between Section and\nUnits in the Logistics Section. Branches are identified\nby the use of Roman numerals, by function, or by\njurisdictional name.\n Division: That organization level having responsibility\nfor operations within a defined geographic area. The\nDivision level is organizationally between the Strike\nTeam and the Branch.\n Group: Groups are established to divide the incident\ninto functional areas of operation. Groups are located\nbetween Branches (when activated) and Resources in\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-62\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nthe Operations Section.\n Unit: That organization element having functional\nresponsibility for a specific incident planning,\nlogistics, or finance activity.\n Task Force: A group of resources with common\ncommunications and a leader that may be\npreestablished and sent to an incident or formed at an\nincident.\n Strike Team/Resource Team: Specified\ncombinations of the same kind and type of resources,\nwith common communications and a leader.\n Single Resource: An individual, a piece of equipment\nand its personnel complement, or an established crew\nor team of individuals with an identified work\nsupervisor, that can be used on an incident.\n• Planning Section: Responsible for the collection, evaluation, and\ndissemination of information related to the incident, and for the\npreparation and documentation of the Incident Action Plan. The\nPlanning Section also maintains information on the current and\nforecasted situation, and on the status of resources assigned to the\nincident. This Section includes the Situation, Resources,\nDocumentation, and Demobilization Units, as well as Technical\nSpecialists.\n• Logistics Section: The Section responsible for providing\nfacilities, services, and materials for the incident. Includes the\nService Branch (Communications Unit, Medical Unit, and Food\nUnit) and Support Branch (Supply Unit, Facilities Unit, and\nGround Support Unit).\n• Finance/Administration Section: The Section responsible for all\nincident costs and financial considerations. The\nFinance/Administration Section includes the Time Unit,\nProcurement Unit, Compensation/Claims Unit, and Cost Unit.\n• Intelligence/Investigations (I/I) Function: Some incidents\ninvolve intensive intelligence gathering and investigative activity,\nand for such incidents, the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand may reconfigure intelligence and investigations\nresponsibilities to meet the needs of the incident. The purpose of\nthe Intelligence/Investigations function is to ensure that\nintelligence and investigative operations and activities are\nproperly managed and coordinated.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-63\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: NIMS Management: Manageable Span of\nControl\nThe optimal span of control for incident management is one supervisor to five subordinates;\nhowever, effective incident management frequently necessitates ratios significantly different\nfrom this. The 1:5 ratio is a guideline, and incident personnel use their best judgment to\ndetermine the actual distribution of subordinates to supervisors for a given incident or EOC\nactivation.\nSpan of control is key to effective and efficient incident management.\nMaintaining an effective span of control is important because safety and\naccountability are a priority.\nNote\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-64\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Span of Control\nWhat influences span of control?\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-65\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Modular Organization\nThe ICS organization adheres to a \"form\nfollows function\" philosophy. The size of the\ncurrent organization and that of the next\noperational period is determined through the\nincident planning process.\nBecause the ICS is a modular concept,\nmanaging span of control is accomplished by\norganizing resources into Teams, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections. When the\nsupervisor-to-subordinate ratio exceeds\nmanageable span of control, additional Teams,\nDivisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections can\nbe established. When a supervisor is managing\ntoo few subordinates, Sections, Branches,\nDivisions, Groups, or Teams can be\nreorganized or demobilized to reach a more\neffective span of control.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-66\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Typical Organizational Structure\nThe initial response to most domestic incidents is\ntypically handled by local \"911\" dispatch centers,\nemergency responders within a single jurisdiction, and\ndirect supporters of emergency responders. Most\nresponses need go no further.\nApproximately 95% of all incidents are small\nresponses that include:\n• Command: Incident Commander and other\nCommand Staff\n• Single Resource: An individual, a piece of\nequipment and its personnel complement, or\nan established crew or team of individuals with\nan identified work supervisor that can be used\non an incident\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-67\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Expanding Incidents\nIncidents that begin with single resources may rapidly expand requiring significant additional\nresources and operational support.\nLesson 2: Incident Command and Unified Command SM-68\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Use of Position Titles\nAt each level within the ICS organization, individuals\nwith primary responsibility positions have distinct\ntitles.

The most common preparedness\nplans are:\n• Federal, State, or local Emergency Operations Plans (EOPs)\n• Standard operating guidelines (SOGs) - a standard indication or\noutline of policy\n• Standard operating procedures (SOPs) - a set of step-by-step\ninstructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out\ncomplex operations\n• Jurisdictional or agency policies\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives SM-100\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 25: Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)\nEOPs are developed at the Federal, State, and local levels to\nprovide a uniform response to all hazards that a community\nmay face.\nEOPs should be consistent with the National Incident\nManagement System (NIMS).\nVisit this website to access the NIMS Resource\nCenter: https://www.fema.gov/national-incident-management-\nsystem\nVisit this website to access the Comprehensive Preparedness\nGuide (CPG) 101: A Guide for All-Hazard Emergency\nOperations\nPlanning: https://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/divisions/npd/CPG\n_101_V2.pdf\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives SM-101\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 26: Mutual Aid Agreements and Compacts\nNIMS states that:\n• Mutual aid agreements establish the legal basis\nfor two or more entities to share resources.\nMutual aid agreements may authorize mutual\naid between two or more neighboring\ncommunities, among all jurisdictions within a\nstate, between states, between Federal agencies,\nand/or internationally.\n• Jurisdictions should be party to agreements with\nthe appropriate jurisdictions and/or\norganizations from which they expect to receive,\nor to which they expect to provide, assistance.\nVisit this website to review the Resource Management\nand Mutual Aid page within the NIMS Resource\nCenter: https://www.fema.gov/resource-management-\nmutual-aid\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives SM-102\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: Mutual Aid Agreements and Compacts\n(Continued)\nMutual aid is the voluntary provision of resources by\nagencies or organizations to assist each other when\nexisting resources are inadequate.\nNIMS resource management describes how mutual aid\nallows jurisdictions to share resources among mutual aid\npartners.\nMutual Aid Agreement Topics\nMutual aid agreements might include some of the following topics:\n• Reimbursement: Mutual aid services are either paid or unpaid (e.g.,\nNote based on providing reciprocal services). Some mutual aid agreements\nspecify reimbursement parameters.\n• Recognition of Licensure and Certification: Guidelines to ensure\nrecognition of licensures across geopolitical boundaries.\n• Procedures for Mobilization (Request, Dispatch, and Response):\nSpecific procedures for parties to request and dispatch resources\nthrough mutual aid.\n• Protocols for Voice and Data Interoperability: Protocols that\nspecify how different communications and IT systems share\ninformation.\n• Protocols for Resource Management: Standard templates for\npackaging resources based on NIMS resource typing definitions\nand/or local inventory systems.\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives SM-103\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Mutual Aid and Assistance: All Levels\nMutual aid agreements and assistance agreements are used at all\nlevels of government:\n• Local jurisdictions participate in mutual aid through\nagreements with neighboring jurisdictions.\n• States can participate in mutual aid through the\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC).\n• Federal agencies offer mutual aid to each other and to\nStates, tribes, and territories under the National\nResponse Framework (NRF).\nEmergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)\nEMAC is a congressionally ratified mutual aid compact that defines a non-\nFederal, state-to-state system for sharing resources across state lines during\nan emergency or disaster. Signatories include all 50 states, the District of\nNote\nColumbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. EMAC’s unique\nrelationships with states, regions, territories, and Federal organizations, such\nas FEMA and the National Guard Bureau, enable it to move a wide variety of\nresources to meet the jurisdictions’ needs.\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives SM-104\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Information Derived from Plans\nPlans may include information about:\n• Hazards and risks in the area\n• Resources in the area\n• Other formal agreements and plans\n• Contact information for agency administrators and\nresponse personnel\n• Other pertinent information\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives SM-105\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Discussion Question\nWhat preparedness plans, agreements, and standard operating procedures must you follow in\nresponding to incidents?\nLesson 3: Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives SM-106\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Lesson Completion\nYou have completed the Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives lesson.

For example, the Incident\nCommander would personally perform the Operations function until an Operations Section\nwas activated.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-111\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Deputy Incident Commander\nThe Incident Commander may have one or more Deputies. Deputies\nmay be assigned at the Incident Command, Section, or Branch levels.\nThe only ICS requirement regarding the use of a Deputy is that the\nDeputy must be fully qualified and equally capable to assume the\nposition.\nThe three primary reasons to designate a Deputy Incident Commander\nare to:\n• Perform specific tasks as requested by the Incident\nCommander.\n• Perform the incident command function in a relief capacity\n(e.g., to take over for the next operational period). In this case,\nthe Deputy will assume the primary role.\n• Represent an Assisting Agency that may share jurisdiction or\nhave jurisdiction in the future.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-112\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Command Staff\nThe Command Staff is only activated in response\nto the needs of the incident. If a Command Staff\nposition is not needed it will not be activated. For\nexample, an incident may not require a Liaison\nOfficer if there are not outside agencies or\norganizations to coordinate with.\nCommand Staff includes the following positions:\n• Public Information Officer\n• Liaison Officer\n• Safety Officer\nCommand Staff Functions\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command assigns Command Staff as\nneeded to support the command function. The Command Staff typically\nincludes a Public Information Officer (PIO), a Safety Officer, and a Liaison\nNote\nOfficer who report directly to the Incident Commander or Unified Command\nand have assistants as necessary. The Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand may appoint additional advisors as needed.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-113\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 6: Discussion Question\nWhat are the major responsibilities of the Public Information Officer?\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-114\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Discussion Question\nWhat are the major responsibilities of the Safety Officer?\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-115\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Discussion Question\nWhat are the major responsibilities of the Liaison Officer?\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-116\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nCommand Staff Functions Table\nCommand Staff Responsibilities\nPublic Information Officer (PIO) The PIO interfaces with the public, media,\nand/or with other agencies with incident-\nrelated information needs. The PIO gathers,\nverifies, coordinates, and disseminates\naccessible,15 meaningful, and timely\ninformation on the incident for both internal\nand external audiences. The PIO also monitors\nthe media and other sources of public\ninformation to collect relevant information and\ntransmits this information to the appropriate\ncomponents of the incident management\norganization. In incidents that involve PIOs\nfrom different agencies, the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command designates\none as the lead PIO. All PIOs should work in a\nunified manner, speaking with one voice, and\nensure that all messaging is consistent. The\nIncident Commander or Unified Command\napproves the release of incident-related\ninformation. In large-scale incidents, the PIO\nparticipates in or leads the Joint Information\nCenter (JIC).\nSafety Officer The Safety Officer monitors incident\noperations and advises the Incident\nCommander or Unified Command on matters\nrelating to the health and safety of incident\npersonnel. Ultimate responsibility for the safe\nconduct of incident management rests with the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command and\nsupervisors at all levels. The Safety Officer is\nresponsible to the Incident Commander or\nUnified Command for establishing the systems\nand procedures necessary to assess,\ncommunicate, and mitigate hazardous\nenvironments. This includes developing and\nmaintaining the incident Safety Plan,\ncoordinating multiagency safety efforts, and\nimplementing measures to promote the safety\nof incident personnel and incident sites. The\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-117\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nCommand Staff Responsibilities\nSafety Officer stops and/or prevents unsafe\nacts during the incident. Agencies,\norganizations, or jurisdictions that contribute to\njoint safety management efforts do not lose\ntheir individual responsibilities or authorities\nfor their own programs, policies, and\npersonnel. Rather, each contributes to the\noverall effort to protect all personnel involved\nin the incident.\nLiaison Officer The Liaison Officer is the incident command’s\npoint of contact for representatives of\ngovernmental agencies, jurisdictions, NGOs,\nand private sector organizations that are not\nincluded in the Unified Command. Through\nthe Liaison Officer, these representatives\nprovide input on their agency, organization, or\njurisdiction’s policies, resource availability,\nand other incident-related matters. Under either\na single Incident Commander or a Unified\nCommand structure, representatives from\nassisting or cooperating jurisdictions and\norganizations coordinate through the Liaison\nOfficer. The Liaison Officer may have\nassistants.\nSource: National Incident Management System (NIMS)\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-118\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Assistants\nIn a large or complex incident, Command Staff members may\nneed one or more Assistants to help manage their workloads.\nEach Command Staff member is responsible for organizing his\nor her Assistants for maximum efficiency. Assistants are\nsubordinates of principal Command Staff positions.\nAs the title indicates, Assistants should have a level of technical\ncapability, qualifications, and responsibility subordinate to the\nprimary positions.\nAssistants may also be assigned to Unit Leaders (e.g., at camps\nto supervise unit activities).\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-119\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Discussion Question\nScenario: On July 18, 2001, a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed and caught fire in a\ndowntown Baltimore tunnel, causing a near shutdown of the city and burning so hot that\nfirefighters couldn't reach the flames for 8 hours.\nAt one point, all major highways into the city were blocked off, a Baltimore Orioles game at\nnearby Camden Yards was canceled, and the Inner Harbor was closed to boat traffic. A water-\nmain break near the tunnel added to the chaos, causing the collapse of part of a major\nthoroughfare and power outages.\nWhat is your recommended course of action?\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-120\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Assisting Agency\nAn agency or jurisdiction will often send resources to assist at\nan incident. In ICS these are called assisting agencies.\nAn assisting agency is defined as an agency or organization\nproviding personnel, services, or other resources to the agency\nwith direct responsibility for incident management.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-121\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Cooperating Agency\nA cooperating agency is an agency supplying assistance other\nthan direct operational or support functions or resources to\nthe incident management effort.\nDon't get confused between an assisting agency and a\ncooperating agency!\nAn assisting agency has direct responsibility for incident\nresponse, whereas a cooperating agency is simply offering\nassistance.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-122\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Agency Representative\nAn Agency Representative is an individual assigned to an\nincident from an assisting or cooperating agency. The Agency\nRepresentative is delegated authority to make decisions on\nmatters affecting that agency's participation at the incident.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-123\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 14: Expanding Incidents\nAn incident may start small and then expand. As the incident\ngrows in scope and the number of resources needed increases,\nthere may be a need to activate Teams, Units, Divisions,\nGroups, Branches, or Sections to maintain an appropriate span\nof control. The optimal span of control for incident\nmanagement is one supervisor to five subordinates; however,\neffective incident management may require ratios different from\nthis. The 1:5 ratio is just a guideline.\nThe ability to delegate the supervision of resources not only\nfrees up the Incident Commander to perform critical decision-\nmaking and evaluation duties, but also clearly defines the lines\nof communication to everyone involved in the incident.\nNext, we'll review the major organizational elements that may\nbe activated during an expanding incident.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-124\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Operations Section\nThe Operations Section:\n• Directs and coordinates all incident tactical\noperations\n• Is typically one of the first organizations to be\nassigned to the incident\n• Expands from the bottom up\n• Has the most incident resources\n• May have Staging Areas and special\norganizations\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-125\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 16: Operations Section Chief\nThe Operations Section Chief:\n• Is responsible to the Incident Commander for\nthe direct management of all incident-related\noperational activities\n• Establishes tactical objectives for each\noperational period\n• Has direct involvement in the preparation of\nthe Incident Action Plan\nThe Operations Section Chief may have one or more\nDeputies assigned. The assignment of Deputies from\nother agencies may be advantageous in the case of\nmultijurisdictional incidents.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-126\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 17: Operations Section: Staging Areas\nStaging Areas are set up at the incident where resources can\nwait for a tactical assignment.\nAll resources in the Staging Area are assigned and ready for\ndeployment. Out-of-service resources are NOT located at the\nStaging Area.\nAfter a Staging Area has been designated and named, a Staging\nArea Manager will be assigned. The Staging Area Manager will\nreport to the Operations Section Chief or to the Incident\nCommander if the Operations Section Chief has not been\ndesignated.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-127\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: Staging Areas: Chain of Command\nThe graphic below shows where the Staging Area Manager fits into the Operations Section.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-128\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 19: Divisions and Groups\nDivisions are established to divide an incident into physical or geographical areas of operation.\nGroups are established to divide the incident into functional areas of operation.\nFor example, a Damage Assessment Task Force, reporting to the Infrastructure Group\nSupervisor, could work across divisions established to manage two distinct areas of the building\nthat have been damaged — the west side of the building (West Division) and the north side\n(North Division).\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-129\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 20: Branches\nBranches may be used to serve several purposes and may be functional or geographic in\nnature. Branches are established when the number of divisions or groups exceeds an effective\nspan of control for the Operations Section Chief.\nBranches are identified by Roman numerals or functional name.\nBranches are managed by a Branch Director. Branch Directors may have\nNote deputy positions as required. In multiagency incidents, the use of Deputy\nBranch Directors from assisting agencies can be of great benefit to ensure\nand enhance interagency coordination.\nLesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions SM-130\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 21: Activity 4.1: The Expanding Incident\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at maintaining span of control by adjusting the ICS\norganization structure as an expanding scenario incident unfolds.\nTime: 30 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .",

In addition to these\nIAP related meetings, there will also be other\nmeetings and briefings within the ICS\norganization to include section-level meetings\nand briefings, situation update briefings, and\ntransfer of command briefings.\nOperational Period Planning Cycle\nInitial Response and Assessment\nNote\nThe responder(s) who is first to arrive at the incident scene conducts the\ninitial assessment and takes whatever immediate response actions are\nappropriate and possible. The initial or rapid assessment is essential to\ngaining and maintaining situational awareness. It enables the Incident\nCommander to request additional resources and/or support, develop, and\nimplement initial tactics. Jurisdiction officials might decide to activate an\nEOC based on the initial assessment.\nAgency Administrator Briefing\nThe Agency Administrator Briefing is a presentation to the personnel who\nwill be managing or supporting the incident by the administrator or other\nsenior official of the jurisdiction, agency, or organization affected by the\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-156\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nincident. This briefing occurs when the Incident Commander or Unified\nCommand are assuming duties outside their normal responsibilities or are\nfrom an entity or jurisdictional area that does not possess authority to the\nmanage the incident they are being assigned. In such cases, the briefing\nprovides supporting details to the delegation of authority or other document\nthat the jurisdiction, agency, or organization typically provides to the\nIncident Commander or Unified Command.\nDuring the briefing, the agency administrator or a designee provides\ninformation, guidance, and direction—including priorities and constraints—\nnecessary for the successful management of the incident. The briefing is\nintended to ensure a common understanding between the jurisdiction,\nagency, or organization and the incident personnel regarding such things as\nthe environmental, social, political, economic, and cultural issues relevant to\nthe incident and its location.\nIncident Briefing\nThe incident briefing marks the transition from reactive to proactive incident\nmanagement. The initial responder(s) typically delivers the briefing to the\nincoming Incident Commander or Unified Command. This meeting enables\nthe incoming Incident Commander or Unified Command to initiate planning\nfor the next operational period.\nInitial Unified Command Meeting\nIf a Unified Command is managing the incident, the Initial Unified\nCommand Meeting allows members of the Unified Command to meet in\nprivate to discuss each jurisdiction or organization’s priorities and objectives\nas well as any limitations, concerns, and restrictions. During the Initial\nUnified Command Meeting, members of the Unified Command generally\naccomplish the next step by developing the initial joint incident objectives.\nObjectives Development/Update\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command establishes the incident\nobjectives for the initial operational period. After the initial operational\nperiod, the Incident Commander or Unified Command reviews the incident\nobjectives and may validate them, modify them, or develop new objectives.\nIncident objectives are based on incident priorities and other requirements.\nClearly communicated priorities and objectives support unity of effort among\nincident personnel and enable the development of appropriate strategies and\ntactics. When the members of the team clearly understand the intent behind\ntheir instructions, they are better equipped to act decisively and make good\ndecisions.\nStrategy Meeting/Command and General Staff Meeting\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-157\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nAfter developing or revising the incident objectives, the Incident Commander\nor Unified Command typically meets with the Command and General Staff,\nand sometimes others, to discuss the incident objectives and provide\ndirection. This meeting may be called the Strategy Meeting or the Command\nand General Staff Meeting and is held as needed to determine how best to\nmeet the incident objectives.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting, which is held the first time through the planning\ncycle, is particularly important, because it allows team members to share\ninformation and jointly determine the initial approach to response operations.\nThe initial Strategy Meeting may include the initial Incident Commander and\na representative from the Agency Administrator.\nPreparing for the Tactics Meeting\nOnce the approach to achieving or working toward achieving the incident\nobjectives is determined, the Operations Section Chief and staff prepare for\nthe Tactics Meeting by developing tactics and determining the resources that\nwill be applied during the operational period.\nTactics Meeting\nThe Tactics Meeting is a forum for key players to review the proposed tactics\ndeveloped by the Operations Section staff and to conduct planning for\nresource assignments. The Operations Section Chief leads the Tactics\nMeeting, and key participants include the Logistics Section Chief, Safety\nOfficer, a representative from the Planning Section—typically, the Resources\nUnit Leader—and other technical specialists or team members invited by the\nOperations Section Chief, Logistics Section Chief, or Safety Officer. The\nteam uses ICS Forms 215 and 215A, the Operational Planning Worksheet\nand the Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis, to facilitate and document\ndecisions they make during the meeting.\nPreparing for the Planning Meeting\nFollowing the Tactics Meeting, preparations begin for the Planning Meeting.\nTeam members collaborate between the Tactics Meeting and the Planning\nMeeting to identify support needs and assign specific operational resources\nto accomplish the operational plan.\nPlanning Meeting\nThe Planning Meeting serves as a final review and approval of operational\nplans and resource assignments developed during and after the Tactics\nMeeting. Ideally, the Planning Meeting involves no surprises and simply\nserves as a review of a plan that the Command and General Staff have\ncollaboratively developed and agreed upon. At the end of the Planning\nMeeting, Command and General Staff, and any agency officials involved,\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-158\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nconfirm that they can support the plan.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-159\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Effective Meetings and Briefings\nEffective briefings and meetings are:\n• An essential element to good supervision and incident\nmanagement\n• Intended to pass along vital information required in the\ncompletion of incident response actions\nTypically, these briefings are concise and do not include long\ndiscussions or complex decision-making. Rather, they allow\nincident managers and supervisors to communicate specific\ninformation and expectations for the upcoming work period and\nto answer questions.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-160\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Levels of Briefings\nThere are three types of briefings/meetings used in ICS: staff\nlevel, field level, and section level.\n• Staff-level briefings are delivered to resources\nassigned to nonoperational and support tasks at the\nIncident Command Post or Base.\n• Field-level briefings are delivered to individual\nresources or crews who are assigned to operational\ntasks and/or work at or near the incident site.\n• Section-level briefings are delivered to an entire\nSection and include the Operational Period\nBriefing.\nBriefing Types\nStaff-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to nonoperational and\nNote support tasks that are commonly performed at the Incident Base or Command\nPost. These briefings will be delivered to individual staff members or full\nunits within a section. These briefings occur at the beginning of the\nassignment to the incident and as necessary during the assignment. The\nsupervisor attempts to clarify tasks and scope of the work as well as define\nreporting schedule, subordinate responsibilities and delegated authority, and\nthe supervisor's expectations. The supervisor will also introduce coworkers\nand define actual workspace, sources of work supplies, and work schedule.\nField-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves resources assigned to operational tasks and/or\nwork at or near the incident site. These briefings will be delivered to\nindividual subordinates, full crews, or multiple crews such as Strike Teams\nor Task Forces and will occur at the beginning of an operational shift. The\nlocation will usually be near the work site or just prior to mobilization to the\nfield. The supervisor attempts to focus the subordinates on their specific\ntasks and helps define work area, reporting relationships, and expectations.\nSection-Level Briefings\nThis level typically involves the briefing of an entire Section (Operations,\nPlanning, Logistics, or Finance/Administration) and is done by the specific\nSection Chief. These briefings occur at the beginning of the assignment to\nthe incident and after the arrival of Section supervisory staff. The Section\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-161\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nChief may schedule periodic briefings at specific times (once per day) or\nwhen necessary. A unique briefing in this category is the Operational\nPeriod Briefing (also called a Shift Operations Briefing). Here, the\nOperations Section Chief presents the plan for all operational elements for\nthe specific operational period. This specific briefing is done at the beginning\nof each operation shift and prior to the operational resources being deployed\nto the area of work. Often, a field-level briefing will take place subsequent to\nthe completion of the Operational Period Briefing.\nDuring any section-level briefing, the supervisor attempts to share incident-\nwide direction from the Incident Commander (IC), how the direction impacts\nthe Section staff, and specific ways the Section will support the IC's\ndirection. The supervisor will establish Section staffing requirements,\nSection work tasks, Section-wide scheduling rules, and overall timelines for\nmeetings and completion of work products.\nLesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings SM-162\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Activity 5.1: Briefing Information\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at determining the appropriate details required when\npreparing for an incident briefing and identifying information pertinent to the audience to\nbe covered in the briefing.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your group:",

The ICS\norganization may be expanded easily from a very small size for\nroutine operations to a larger organization capable of handling\ncatastrophic events.\nStandardization within ICS does NOT limit flexibility. ICS\nworks for small, routine operations as well as catastrophic\nevents.\nFlexibility does NOT mean that the NIMS Management\nCharacteristic Common Terminology is superseded. Flexibility\nis exercised only within the standard ICS organizational\nstructure and position titles. Flexibility does not mean using\nnon-standard organizational structures or position titles that\nwould interfere with the NIMS Management Characteristics\nCommon Terminology and Modular Organization.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-176\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Modular Organization\nIncident command organizational structure is based on:\n• Size and complexity of the incident\n• Specifics of the hazard environment created by\nthe incident\n• Incident planning process and incident\nobjectives\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-177\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Discussion Question\nShould an incident's ICS organizational structure include all General and Command Staff\nfunctions and positions at all times?\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-178\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: ICS Expansion and Contraction\nAlthough there are no hard-and-fast rules, it is important to\nremember that:\n• Only functions and positions that are necessary to achieve\nincident objectives are filled.\n• Each activated element must have a person in charge.\n• An effective span of control must be maintained.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-179\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 6: Activation of Organizational Elements\nMany incidents will never require the activation of\nthe entire Command or General Staff or entire list of\norganizational elements within each Section. Other\nincidents will require some or all members of the\nCommand Staff and all sub-elements of each General\nStaff section.\nThe decision to activate an element (Section,\nBranch, Division, Group or Unit) must be based on\nincident objectives and resource needs.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-180\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Activation of Organizational Elements\n(Continued)\nAn important concept is that many organizational\nelements may be activated in various Sections without\nactivating the Section Chief.\nFor example, the Situation Unit can be activated without a\nPlanning Section Chief assigned. In this case, the\nsupervision of the Situation Unit will rest with the\nIncident Commander.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-181\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Discussion Question\nShould you combine ICS positions and titles in order to save on staffing or achieve a higher\nlevel of efficiency?\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-182\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Avoid Combining Positions\nIt is tempting to combine ICS positions to gain staffing efficiency. Rather than combining\npositions, you may assign the same individual to supervise multiple units.\nWhen assigning personnel to multiple positions, do not use nonstandard titles. Creating new\ntitles may be unrecognizable to assisting or cooperating personnel and may cause confusion.\nBe aware of potential span-of-control issues that may arise from assigning one person to\nmultiple positions.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-183\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Resource Management\nMaintaining an accurate and up-to-date picture of\nresource utilization is a critical component of\nincident management. The incident resource\nmanagement process consists of the following:\n• Identifying Requirements\n• Ordering and Acquiring\n• Mobilizing\n• Tracking and Reporting\n• Demobilizing\n• Reimbursing and Restocking\nThis section of the lesson reviews key resource\nmanagement principles.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-184\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Anticipating Incident Resource Needs\nExperience and training will help you to predict\nworkloads and corresponding staffing needs. As the\ngraphic illustrates, an incident may build faster than\nresources can arrive.\nEventually, a sufficient number of resources arrive\nand begin to control the incident. As the incident\ndeclines, resources then exceed incident needs.\nRemember that when resources increase or decrease\nyou will have to reassess your organizational\nstructure and staffing to determine if it is right-sized\nfor the resources that are being managed.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-185\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Predicting Incident Workload\nIncident workload patterns are often predictable throughout\nthe incident life cycle. Several examples are provided below:\n• Operations Section: The workload on Operations is\nimmediate and often massive. On a rapidly escalating\nincident, the Operations Section Chief must\ndetermine appropriate tactics; organize, assign, and\nsupervise resources; and at the same time participate\nin the planning process.\n• Planning Section: The Resources and Situation Units\nwill be very busy in the initial phases of the incident.\nIn the later stages, the workload of the\nDocumentation and Demobilization Units will\nincrease.\n• Logistics Section: The Supply and Communications\nUnits will be very active in the initial and final stages\nof the incident.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-186\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: Analyzing Incident Complexity\nIt is important to strike the right balance when determining\nresource needs. Having too few resources can lead to loss of life\nand property, while having too many resources can result in\nunqualified personnel deployed without proper supervision.\nA complexity analysis can help:\n• Identify resource requirements\n• Determine if the existing management structure is\nappropriate\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-187\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 14: Complexity Analysis Factors\n• Community and responder safety\n• Impacts to life, property, and the economy\n• Potential hazardous materials\n• Weather and other environmental influences\n• Likelihood of cascading events\n• Potential crime scene (including terrorism)\n• Political sensitivity, external influences, and media relations\n• Area involved, jurisdictional boundaries\n• Availability of resources\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-188\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 15: Activity 6.1: Complexity Analysis\nActivity Purpose: To give the students practice at identifying the indicators that are considered\nwhen analyzing and determining the complexity of an incident.\nTime: 20 minutes\nInstructions: Working in your team:",

Typing is done to ensure\nthat responders get the right personnel and\nequipment.\nICS resources are categorized by Capability,\nCategory, Kind, and Type.\n• Capability: The Core Capability for which a\nresource is most useful.\n• Category: The function for which a\nresource is most useful.\n• Kind: A description of what a resource is\n(personnel, teams, facilities, equipment or\nsupplies).\n• Type: The resource's minimum capability to\nperform its function. The level of capability\nis based on size, power and capacity (for\nequipment), or experience and qualifications\n(for personnel or teams).\nResource Typing Example\nExample:\nAn Ambulance Ground Team is in the Emergency Medical Services\nNote Category. It's Resource Kind is a Team. The definition of a Type 3\nAmbulance Ground Team includes a crew of 2 (an EMT 1 and an\nAmbulance Operator), with Basic Life Support (BLS) Capability, and the\ncapacity to transport 2 non-ambulatory patients.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-193\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 18: Discussion Question\nWhich is a kind?

Type 5 incidents are the least complex and Type 1 the most\ncomplex. Incident typing may be used to:\n• Make decisions about resource requirements.\n• Order Incident Management Teams (IMTs). An IMT is made up of\nthe Command and General Staff members in an ICS organization.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-200\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 25: Incident Typing: Overview (Continued)\nThe incident type corresponds to both the number of resources required and the anticipated\nincident duration. The incident types move from Type 5 being the least complex to Type 1\nbeing the most complex. As the number of resources required gets larger and the duration of\nthe incident gets longer, the complexity increases. The vast majority of incidents are in the\nType 3-5 range.\nClocks do not depict length of incident time.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-201\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 26: Type 5 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 5 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: One or two single resources with up to six\npersonnel. Command and General Staff positions (other\nthan the Incident Commander) are not activated.\n• Time Span: Incident is contained within the first\noperational period and often within a few hours after\nresources arrive on scene. No written Incident Action\nPlan is required.\nExamples include a vehicle fire, an injured person, or a police\ntraffic stop.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-202\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 27: Type 4 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 4 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: Command Staff and General\nStaff functions are activated (only if\nneeded). Several single resources are\nrequired to mitigate the incident.\n• Time Span: Limited to one operational\nperiod in the control phase. No written\nIncident Action Plan is required for non-\nHazMat incidents. A documented\noperational briefing is completed.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-203\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 28: Type 3 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 3 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: When capabilities exceed initial response,\nthe appropriate ICS positions should be added to match\nthe complexity of the incident. Some or all of the\nCommand and General Staff positions may be activated,\nas well as Division or Group Supervisor and/or Unit\nLeader level positions. An Incident Management Team\n(IMT) or incident command organization manages initial\naction incidents with a significant number of resources,\nand an extended response incident until\ncontainment/control is achieved.\n• Time Span: The incident may extend into multiple\noperational periods and a written Incident Action Plan\nmay be required for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-204\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Type 2 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 2 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: Regional and/or national resources are\nrequired to safely and effectively manage the operations.\nMost or all Command and General Staff positions are\nfilled. Operations personnel typically do not exceed 200\nper operational period and the total does not exceed 500.\nThe agency administrator/official is responsible for the\nincident complexity analysis, agency administrator\nbriefings, and written delegation of authority.\n• Time Span: The incident is expected to go into multiple\noperational periods. A written Incident Action Plan is\nrequired for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-205\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Type 1 Incident\nCharacteristics of a Type 1 Incident are as follows:\n• Resources: National resources are required to safely and\neffectively manage the operations. All Command and\nGeneral Staff positions are activated, and Branches need\nto be established. Operations personnel often exceed 500\nper operational period and total personnel will usually\nexceed 1,000. There is a high impact on the local\njurisdiction, requiring additional staff for office\nadministrative and support functions. The incident may\nresult in a disaster declaration.\n• Time Span: The incident is expected to go into multiple\noperational periods. A written Incident Action Plan is\nrequired for each operational period.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-206\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 31: Incident Management Teams (IMTs)\nIMTs are rostered groups of ICS-qualified personnel consisting\nof an Incident Commander, other incident leadership, and\npersonnel qualified for other key ICS positions. An IMT may be\nused to respond to an incident. IMTs include Command and\nGeneral Staff members. IMT types correspond to incident type\nand include:\n• Type 5: Local Village and Township Level\n• Type 4: City, County, or Fire District Level\n• Type 3: State, Territory, Tribal, or Metropolitan Area\nLevel\n• Type 2: National and State Level\n• Type 1: National and State Level (Type 1 Incident)\nTeam members are certified as having the necessary training\nand experience to fulfill IMT positions.\nLesson 6: Organizational Flexibility SM-207\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 32: Activity 6.2: Incident Types\nActivity Purpose: To give students practice at determining incident types for various scenarios.\nTime: 15 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team:",

A\nfew moments later, as the crowd begins to react, the\nlarge truck catches fire.\nSeveral people were injured as the tanker truck\npassed through the crowd and there could be deaths.\nThere is disorder as some attempt to flee and others\ntry to help.\nThe large truck is an active fire that must be\nsuppressed and could spread to nearby structures.\nThere are other potential hazards including a\ndamaged building and utilities (power, water, and\ngas) that could be damaged.\nPublic safety personnel on scene- law enforcement,\nfire, and EMS- respond immediately to the incident.\nBoth the Central City and Liberty County\nEmergency Operations Centers are notified of these\nevents and prepare to send any additional resources\nrequired for the incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-239\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Establish Command\nIt is now approximately 5:15 pm. You are the first\nsupervisor on scene and there is a need to quickly to\nestablish Incident Command.\nLet’s review a few of the NIMS Management\nCharacteristics that apply to determining the best\napproach for the Incident Command function in an\nincident:\n• Establishment and Transfer of Command - the\nfirst on scene need to explicitly establish incident\nor unified command and clearly state and record\nwhen command is transferred.\n• Chain of Command and Unity of Command -\nall responders must be under a single command\nstructure led by a designated Incident\nCommander (IC) or Unified Command (UC).\n• Unified Command - if multiple organizations,\ndisciplines, or jurisdictions are involved in the\nresponse, is a single IC sufficient, or is there a\nneed for a unified command? UC is normally\nused for incidents involving multiple\njurisdictions, a single jurisdiction with\nmultiagency involvement, or multiple\njurisdictions with multiagency involvement.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-240\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Activity 8.1: Establish Command\nActivity Purpose: To apply key concepts regarding establishing command.\nTime: 10 minutes\nInstructions: Working with your team . . .",

Additional resources\nwill be arriving soon and the Incident Commander\nwill need additional staff personnel to help in the\nmanagement in the incident response.\nEstablish an ICS Structure (Continued)\nThere are several NIMS Management Characteristics that can be applied to\ndetermining the appropriate ICS structure for an incident:\nNote • Chain of Command and Unity of Command: All resources should\nwork for a single general staff section and all general staff sections\nshould report to and receive direction from a single IC.\n• Manageable Span of Control: the ICS structure must be of a\nsufficient size to assist the IC in effectively managing the incident. A\nkey to this is constraining the number of subordinates or functions\nthat each supervisor manages.\n• Modular Organization: what pieces of the ICS structure are needed\nto manage the incident? Think ahead to the next operational period\nbecause what you need then often must be asked for now.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-264\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 29: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nWhat ICS Command and General Staff positions will you need\nto manage the incident?\nRemember that the Incident Commander/Unified Command is\nresponsible for performing all of these functions personally\nuntil he or she activates that function.\n• Incident Command\n• Public Information\n• Safety\n• Liaison\n• Operations\n• Planning\n• Logistics\n• Finance/Administration\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-265\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 30: Establish an ICS Structure (Cont)\nWe previously assessed that this is a Type 4 Incident.\nWe expect several pieces of fire apparatus, ambulance crews, and\nlaw enforcement personnel to be involved.

Incident\nobjectives, tactics, and assignments for\noperations and support should be recorded and\ncommunicated through an Incident Action Plan\n(IAP). As your incident increased in size,\ncomplexity, and length, you should have started\nto document incident response activities in a\nwritten plan.\nThe ICS Form 201 is a standard format to record\nkey situational information and document\nactions taken on an incident.\nLesson 8: Application Activity SM-272\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 37: Lesson Summary\nYou have completed the Application Activity.

After reviewing the summary information, you will receive\ninstructions for taking the course Final Exam.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-275\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 2: Lesson 1: Course Overview (NIMS & ICS\nReview)\n• NIMS provides the Nation with a standardized framework for incident management.\n• ICS, a part of NIMS, is a management system used to meet the demands of incidents\nlarge or small, planned or unplanned.\nThe NIMS Management Characteristics:\n• Common Terminology • Integrated Communications\n• Modular Organization • Establishment and Transfer of\n• Management by Objectives Command\n• Incident Action Planning • Unified Command\n• Manageable Span of Control • Chain of Command and Unity of\n• Incident Facilities and Locations Command\n• Comprehensive Resource Management • Accountability\n• Dispatch/Deployment\n• Information and Intelligence\nManagement\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-276\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 3: Lesson 2: Incident Command and Unified\nCommand\n• Chain of Command is the line of authority that flows down through the organizational\nstructure.\n• Unity of Command means that each individual will be assigned and report to only one\nsupervisor.\n• Unity of Command is different from Unified Command; Unified Command is established\nwhen no one jurisdiction, agency, or organization has primary authority, therefore there is\nno one clear Incident Commander. These multiple agencies work together to\ncommunicate and make command decisions.\n• Communication during an incident may be formal or informal\n• Formal communications must be used for work assignments, resource requests, and\nprogress reports.\n• Informal communication is used to exchange incident or event information only.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-277\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 4: Lesson 2: Incident Command and Unified\nCommand\n• All levels of leadership on an incident should understand and practice the leadership\nprinciples, have a commitment to duty, and take actions that prioritize the safety of\npersonnel.\n• Clear communication is the responsibility of all responders in order to accomplish\nincident objectives. Incident Management Assessments may be conducted by leadership\nafter an incident to help personnel process what happened and why.\n• ICS utilizes a Modular Organization so that the organization can expand and contract as\nan incident grows and shrinks. This modular organization helps maintain an effective\nspan of control.\n• Manageable span of control with Modular Organization is accomplished by organizing\nresources into Teams, Divisions, Groups, Branches, or Sections. Leadership in each\norganizational level holds a unique title.\n• The flexibility allowed for in ICS does not override the importance of Common\nTerminology. Common Terminology must be used to maintain clear communication,\nwhether formal or informal.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-278\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 5: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• Authority is the right or obligation to act on behalf of a department, agency, or\njurisdiction.\n• The scope of authority that an Incident Commander has is determined by existing laws,\npolicies, and procedures. Additional authority may be delegated when necessary.\n• Delegation of authority is the process of granting authority to an individual or agency to\ncarry out specific functions during an incident.\n• Delegation of authority does NOT relieve the granting entity of the responsibility for that\nfunction. Authority can be delegated; responsibility cannot.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-279\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 6: Lesson 3: Delegation of Authority and\nManagement by Objectives\n• When needed, a delegation of authority should contain elements related to restrictions,\nexternal implications and considerations, and planning and communication processes.\n• Authority is implemented by the Incident Commander through the management of\nobjectives. Effective Incident Objectives should be SMART. Objectives are not tactics or\nstrategies; they state what needs to be accomplished, not how to do it.\n• Objectives are a part of the Incident Action Plan, which is completed each operational\nperiod and outlines incident-specific information. It is created through a process known\nas the Operational Period Planning Cycle (Planning P).\n• Incident Command, as well as Command and General Staff, should also have a working\nknowledge of other preparedness plans, such as EOPs, SOGs, SOPs, and mutual aid\nagreements.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-280\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 7: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• The Incident Commander oversees the incident, sets incident objectives, and approves the\nIAP.\n• Command Staff include the Public Information Officer, Safety Officer, and Liaison\nOfficer.\n• The Incident Commander also oversees four sections of the ICS organizational structure:\nOperations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance & Administration. Each of these sections is\nresponsible for a different function during an incident; Sections are led by the General\nStaff who report to the Incident Commander. General Staff are titled as Section Chiefs.\n• Operations directs and coordinates all incident tactical operations.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-281\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 8: Lesson 4: Functional Areas and Positions\n• Planning maintains resource and situation status, prepares the IAP and other documents,\nand looks beyond the current operational period to anticipate potential future problems or\nevents.\n• Logistics is responsible for all support requirements, including communications, facility\nsupplies, medical needs, and food and drink for incident personnel.\n• Finance/Administration provides administrative and financial support services. This\nincludes handling claims related to property damage, injuries, and fatalities.\n• ICS Forms help communicate and organize information between Command, Command\nStaff, General Staff, and other incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-282\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 9: Lesson 5: Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Different meetings and briefings are used during the Incident Action Planning Process to\nshare information.\n• Briefings should be concise and may occur at the staff, field, or section level.\n• Information shared during a briefing includes the current situation and objectives, safety\nissues and emergency procedures, work tasks, facilities and work areas, communication\nprotocols, expectations, resource acquisition procedures, work schedules, and questions\nor concerns.\n• The Operational Period Briefing is led by the Incident Commander to present the IAP.\nCommand and General Staff will also participate to share important information.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-283\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 10: Lesson 6: Organizational Flexibility\n• NIMS requires organizational standardization use of Common Terminology; however,\nICS is still flexible due to its Modular Organization.\n• Functions and positions within the organizational structure are activated and filled based\non the needs and demand of an incident. The ICS organizational structure will expand\nand contract with the incident.\n• Personnel may hold multiple titles within an incident's organizational structure, but the\ntitles must keep consistent with NIMS titles. Titles may not be shortened or combined.\n• Proper Resource Management is essential to maintaining an accurate and up-to-date\npicture of resource utilization and needs.\n• Incidents are typed based on size and complexity. Incident types move from Type 5 as\nthe least complex to Type 1 as the most complex.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-284\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 11: Lesson 7: Transfer of Command\n• Transfer of Command is the process of moving the responsibility for incident command\nfrom one Incident Commander to another Incident Commander or Unified Command.\n• Transfer of Command should take place face-to-face when possible and include a\ncomplete briefing that captures essential information.\n• The transfer of command briefing should include elements such as the situation status,\nincident objectives and priorities, current organization, resource information, incident\ncommunications plan, etc.\n• A notification of the time and date that the transfer of command becomes effective should\nbe communicated to all incident personnel.\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-285\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 12: Congratulations!\nYou should now be able to demonstrate knowledge of how to manage an initial response to an\nincident.\nThe course specifically discussed:\n• Incident Command and Unified Command\n• Delegation of Authority & Management by Objectives\n• Functional Areas & Positions\n• Incident Briefings and Meetings\n• Organizational Flexibility\n• Transfer of Command\n• Application of ICS for Initial Response\nLesson 9: Course Summary SM-286\n\n\nSeptember 2020 IS-0200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response, ICS 200\nVisual 13: IS-200.c Final Exam Instructions\nWhen the review is completed, follow these Final Exam instructions:",
