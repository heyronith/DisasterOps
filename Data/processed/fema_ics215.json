The Operational Planning Worksheet (ICS 215) communicates the decisions made by the Operations Section\nChief during the Tactics Meeting concerning resource assignments and needs for the next operational period. The ICS\n215 is used by the Resources Unit to complete the Assignment Lists (ICS 204) and by the Logistics Section Chief for\nordering resources for the incident.\nPreparation. The ICS 215 is initiated by the Operations Section Chief and often involves logistics personnel, the\nResources Unit, and the Safety Officer. The form is shared with the rest of the Command and General Staffs during the\nPlanning Meeting. It may be useful in some disciplines or jurisdictions to prefill ICS 215 copies prior to incidents.\nDistribution. When the Branch, Division, or Group work assignments and accompanying resource allocations are agreed\nupon, the form is distributed to the Resources Unit to assist in the preparation of the ICS 204. The Logistics Section will\nuse a copy of this worksheet for preparing requests for resources required for the next operational period.\nNotes:\n• This worksheet can be made into a wall mount.\n• Also available as 8½ x 14 (legal size) and 11 x 17 chart.\n• If additional pages are needed, use a blank ICS 215 and repaginate as needed.\nBlock\nBlock Title Instructions\nNumber\n1 Incident Name Enter the name assigned to the incident.\n2 Operational Period Enter the start date (month/day/year) and time (using the 24-hour clock)\n• Date and Time From and end date and time for the operational period to which the form applies.\n• Date and Time To\n3 Branch Enter the Branch of the work assignment for the resources.\n4 Division, Group, or Other Enter the Division, Group, or other location (e.g., Staging Area) of the work\nassignment for the resources.\n5 Work Assignment & Enter the specific work assignments given to each of the Divisions/Groups\nSpecial Instructions and any special instructions, as required.\n6 Resources Complete resource headings for category, kind, and type as appropriate for\nthe incident.
