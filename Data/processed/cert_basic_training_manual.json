CERT trains them in basic\ndisaster response skills such as team organization, disaster medical operations, fire\nsafety, and light search and rescue. Local CERT programs train and organize teams of\nvolunteers to assist their families, neighbors, co-workers, and other community\nmembers during emergencies when professional responders may not be immediately\navailable to provide assistance. Before, during, and after disasters, CERT volunteer\nteams perform basic response activities, including checking in on neighbors, distributing\ninformation to the public, supporting emergency operations centers, and helping to\nmanage traffic and crowds. The ability for CERT volunteers to perform these activities\nfrees up professional responders to focus their efforts on more complex, essential, and\ncritical tasks. CERT volunteers also support their communities by organizing, promoting,\nand participating in emergency preparedness events, activities, and projects.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) developed the CERT program after\nexamining the civilian response to disasters in Mexico and Japan in 1985. The LAFD\nrecognized that citizens are likely to be on their own during the early stages of disaster.\nUnder these circumstances, family members, co-workers, and neighbors will often\nspontaneously come to the aid of each other. While untrained volunteers can be very\neffective in aiding others, their lack of training puts them at risk for injury or death. For\nexample, during the response to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that claimed more\nthan 10,000 lives, untrained volunteers saved 700 lives, but unfortunately, 100\nvolunteers died in the process.\nIn response, the LAFD decided to develop and offer disaster response training to Los\nAngeles residents so that during and after future disasters volunteers would be able to\nassist in a safe, responsible, and effective manner. The LAFD piloted the first CERT\ntraining in 1986. In turn, other fire departments around the country, including\ncommunities where the major threat is hurricanes rather than earthquakes, adopted the\nLAFD’s training model. Building on this development, the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) expanded the CERT materials in 1994 to make them\napplicable to all hazards and made the program available to communities nationwide.\nSince that time, thousands of dedicated trainers, organizations, and citizens have\nembraced the responsibility to learn new skills and become prepared to execute safe\nand effective emergency response capabilities.\nThe National CERT Program Office would like to thank the regional, state, and local\npartners and subject matter experts who contributed to the 2019 CERT Basic Training\nupdate.\nAugust 2019 Page 1\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\nA MODEL FOR COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS\nThe CERT program is critical in the effort to engage everyone in the United States in\nmaking their communities safer, more prepared, and more resilient when incidents\noccur.\nCommunity-based preparedness planning allows us all to prepare for and respond to\nanticipated disruptions and potential hazards following a disaster. As individuals, we can\nprepare our homes and families to cope during that critical period. Through pre-event\nplanning, neighborhoods, and worksites can also work together to help reduce injuries,\nloss of lives, and property damage. Neighborhood preparedness will enhance the ability\nof individuals and communities to reduce their emergency needs and to manage their\nexisting resources until professional assistance becomes available.\nStudies of behavior following disasters have shown that groups working together in the\ndisaster period perform more effectively if there has been prior planning and training for\ndisaster response. These studies also show that organized grassroots efforts may be\nmore successful if they are woven into the social and political fabric of the community—\nneighborhood associations, schools, workplaces, places of worship, and other existing\norganizations.\nEffective response, therefore, requires comprehensive planning and coordination of all\nwho will be involved—government, volunteer groups, private businesses, schools, and\ncommunity organizations. With training and information, individuals and community\ngroups can be prepared to serve as a crucial resource capable of performing many of\nthe emergency functions needed in the immediate post-disaster period. The CERT\nprogram trains individuals to be assets to help communities prepare for effective\ndisaster response.\nWhen Disaster Strikes\nThe damage caused by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes,\nand floods, or from manmade/technological events such as explosions or hazardous\nmaterials accidents can affect all aspects of a community, from government services to\nprivate enterprise to civic activities. These events:\n• Severely restrict or overwhelm our response resources, communications,\ntransportation, and utilities; and\n• Leave many individuals and neighborhoods cut off from outside support.\nDamaged roads and disrupted communications systems may restrict the access of\nemergency response agencies into critically affected areas. Thus, for the initial period\nimmediately following a disaster—often up to three days or longer—individuals,\nhouseholds, and neighborhoods may need to rely on their own resources for:\n• Food;\n• Water; and\n• Shelter.\nIndividual preparedness, planning, survival skills, and mutual aid within neighborhoods\nand worksites during this initial period are essential measures in managing the\nAugust 2019 Page 2\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\naftermath of a disaster. What you do today will have a critical impact on the quality of\nyour survival and your ability to help others safely and effectively. You will be more\nresilient to a potentially disruptive event by learning about the likely hazards in your\ncommunity and your community’s plans and protocols, understanding hazard-specific\nprotective actions and response skills, assembling important emergency supplies, and\nmitigating potential hazards in your home. Subsequently, you will be an important asset\nto your family, neighbors, and other members of your community.\nHow CERTS Operate\nAs each CERT is organized and trained in accordance with standard operating\nprocedures developed by the sponsoring agency, members identify potential meeting\nlocations or staging areas to be used in the event of a disaster.\nThe staging area is where the fire department and other services will interact with\nCERTs. Having a centralized contact point makes it possible to communicate damage\nassessments and allocate volunteer resources more effectively. This is true for all\nCERTs, whether active in a neighborhood, workplace, school, college/university\ncampus, or other venue.\nDamage from disasters may vary considerably from one location to another. In an\nactual disaster, communities will deploy CERTs as needs dictate. Volunteers should\nassess their own needs and the priorities of those in their immediate environment first.\nCERT volunteers who do not encounter a need in their immediate area should then\nreport to their staging area, and the first volunteer to arrive will become the initial Team\nLeader (TL) for the disaster response. The TL may pass leadership to someone else as\nother volunteers arrive. Volunteers who find themselves in a heavily impacted location\nshould send runners to staging areas to get assistance from available resources.\nVolunteers may use ham radios or similar technologies to increase communication\ncapabilities and coordination.\nCERTs provide an effective first-response capability. Acting as individuals first, then as\nteam members, trained CERT volunteers can fan-out within their assigned areas,\nextinguish small fires, turn off natural gas at damaged homes, perform light search and\nrescue, and render basic medical treatment. CERTs also act as effective “eyes and\nears” for uniformed emergency responders. Trained volunteers also offer an important\npotential workforce to service organizations in non-hazardous functions such as shelter\nsupport, crowd control, and evacuation.\nAbout the CERT Basic Training\nIf available, emergency services personnel are the best trained and equipped to handle\nemergencies. Following a catastrophic disaster, however, you and your community may\nbe isolated for an extended period for a myriad of reasons, including the size of the area\naffected, inoperable communications systems, or unpassable roads.\nCERT Basic Training prepares you to help yourself and help others in the event of a\ncatastrophic disaster. Because emergency services personnel will not be able to help\neveryone immediately, you can make a difference by using your CERT training to save\nlives and protect property.\nAugust 2019 Page 3\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\nThis training covers basic skills that are important to know in a disaster when\nemergency services are not available. With training and practice, and by working as a\nteam, you will be able to protect yourself and maximize your capability to help for the\ngreatest number of people after a disaster.\nAugust 2019 Page 4\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\nCOURSE OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES\nThe CERT Basic Training provides individuals who complete this course with the basic\nskills required to respond to their community’s immediate needs in the aftermath of a\ndisaster, when emergency services are not immediately available. By working together,\nCERT volunteers can help save lives and protect property using the basic techniques in\nthis course. The target audience for this course is individuals who desire the skills and\nknowledge required to prepare for and respond to a disaster.\nOverall Course Objectives\nUpon completing this course, the participants should be able to:\n1. Take steps to prepare themselves, their families, and their communities for a\ndisaster;\n2. Describe the function and organization of a CERT program and the role CERTs\nserve in immediate disaster response;\n3. Recognize life-threatening conditions and apply appropriate life-saving\ntechniques, conduct patient head-to-toe assessments, employ basic treatment\nfor injuries, and understand disaster medical operations;\n4. Describe the post-disaster emotional environment and the steps that volunteers\ncan take to relieve their own stressors and those of disaster survivors;\n5. Identify and reduce potential fire hazards in their homes, workplaces, and\nneighborhoods and perform basic fire suppression strategies, resources, and\nsafety measures;\n6. Describe the most common techniques associated with light search and rescue\noperations including identifying planning and size-up requirements, searching a\nstructure, debris removal, survivor extrication, and rescuer safety; and\n7. Explain current terrorism trends and measures CERT volunteers can take to\nincrease preparedness before and safety during a terrorism incident.\nIn addition to the overall course objectives listed above, each unit has specific\nobjectives.\nAugust 2019 Page 5\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\nCOURSE AGENDA\nThe agenda for this course is outlined below.

Your\ncommunity may also provide additional documents that will identify you as an\nemergency response team volunteer during disaster response.\nIn addition, you should maintain your CERT safety equipment—such as goggles,\ngloves, and basic first aid supplies—and have them available for use during a disaster.\nTraining in disaster response should not be a one-time event. You should reinforce your\nskills through follow-up training and repeated practice to maintain the skills necessary\nfor effective response to a disaster.\nTo maintain your skill level and continually improve performance, you and your team\nshould participate in continuing supplemental training when offered in your area.\nWorking through practice disaster scenarios with other teams will provide opportunities\nnot only for extended practice, but also for valuable networking with teams in the local\narea.\nAugust 2019 Page 8\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nCERT Unit

UNIT 1 OVERVIEW\nSetting the Stage\nThe damage caused by natural disasters and manmade events can be extensive. While\nemergency services personnel are the best trained and equipped to handle\nemergencies, they may not be immediately available following a disaster. In such a\nsituation, volunteers of the community may be on their own for several days or longer.\nThey may have to rely on their own resources for food, water, first aid, and shelter.\nAdditionally, neighbors or coworkers may have to provide immediate assistance to\nthose who are hurt or need help.\nCommunity Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) respond in the period immediately\nafter a disaster when response resources are overwhelmed or delayed.\nCERTs are able to:\n• Assist emergency services personnel when requested in accordance with\nstandard operating procedures (SOPs) developed by the sponsoring agency and\nby area of training;\n• Assume some of the same functions as emergency services personnel following\na disaster; and\n• Prepare families and communities prior to emergencies and assist neighbors\nduring an emergency when first responders are not immediately available.\nWhile CERTs are a valuable asset in emergency response, CERTs are not trained to\nperform all of the functions to respond to the same degree as professional responders.\nCERTs are a bridge to professional responders until they are able to arrive. This training\ncovers basic skills that are important to know in a disaster when emergency services\npersonnel are not immediately available.\nUnit 1 Objectives\nAt the end of this unit on disaster preparedness, you should be able to:\n1. Describe the functions of CERT, discuss your role as CERT volunteers, and\nexplain how CERT fits into your community’s emergency preparedness structure;\n2. Describe the types of hazards most likely to affect your communities and their\npotential impact on people, health, and infrastructure; and\n3. Prepare yourself and your family for potential disasters your community may\nface, including learning to create a family disaster plan and emergency\npreparedness kit.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nExercise 1.1: Building a Tower\nInstructions: Follow the steps below to complete this exercise:\n1. Work in groups of five to design and construct a freestanding tower that stands at\nleast 5 feet tall from the bottom of the structure to the top.\n2. You will have a total of 10 minutes. Spend the first 5 minutes planning and\ndesigning the tower as a group. While you are planning, you should not touch\nany of the materials.\n3. Wait to be instructed when to begin construction; you will have 5 minutes from\nthat point to complete the tower.\nThe problem solving, communication, and team coordination skills that you use during\nthis exercise are the same skills that you will use as CERT volunteers.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS ROLES AND\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nCommunity preparedness is a key priority in lessening the impact of disasters. It is\ncritical that all community members take steps to prepare in advance of an event.\nEffective community preparedness addresses the unique attributes of the community:\n• The threat and hazards profile and vulnerabilities of the area;\n• The existing infrastructure;\n• Resources and skills within the community; and\n• The population composition of the community.\nEffective community preparedness also engages the whole community, which includes:\n• Government leaders and the public sector;\n• Community leaders from the private and civic sectors; and\n• The public, including volunteer groups, faith-based groups, and tribal\ncommunities.\nGovernment\nGovernment has the responsibility to develop, test, and refine emergency operations\nplans; ensure emergency responders have adequate skills and resources; and provide\nservices to protect and assist its citizens. In meeting these challenges, government also\nhas the responsibility to involve the community in the planning process, to incorporate\ncommunity resources in the plans, to provide reliable, actionable information, and to\nencourage training, practicing, and volunteer programs.\nGovernment emergency service providers include professionals from the following\nfields:\n• Emergency management;\n• Emergency medical services;\n• Fire and rescue;\n• Human services;\n• Law enforcement;\n• Public health services; and\n• Public works.\nThe Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)\nAll government agencies with a role in disaster response work to organize and\ncoordinate their agencies’ activities before an emergency or disaster. The product of\ntheir work is the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for that community.\nThe EOP is a document that:\n• Assigns responsibility to organizations and individuals for carrying out specific\nactions at projected times and places in an emergency that exceeds the\ncapability or routine responsibility of any one agency (e.g., the fire department);\nAugust 2019 Page 1-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\n• Sets forth lines of authority and organizational relationships and shows how all\nactions will be coordinated;\n• Describes how to protect people and property in emergencies and disasters; and\n• Identifies personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies, and other resources\navailable—within the jurisdiction or by agreement with other jurisdictions—for use\nduring response and recovery operations.\nIn short, the EOP describes how the community will function in an emergency.\nCommunity Leaders\nCommunity leaders from the private and civic sectors have a responsibility to participate\nin community preparedness. Their responsibilities include:\n• Participating on the local collaborative planning council to provide insights and\nperspectives reflecting their industry or the constituency they service. For\nexample, people with disabilities, local schools, communities with language or\ncultural differences, small businesses, the economically disadvantaged, and\ncommunities of faith;\n• Identifying and integrating appropriate resources into government plans; and\n• Ensuring facilities, staff, and customers or population served are prepared,\ntrained, and practiced in preparedness actions.\nThe Public\nThe public also has a responsibility for preparedness. All members of the community\nshould:\n• Learn about the community alerts and warnings, evacuation routes, and how to\nget critical information;\n• Take training in preparedness, first aid, and response skills;\n• Practice skills and personal plans through periodic drills in multiple settings;\n• Network and be able to help others;\n• Participate in community feedback opportunities;\n• Report suspicious activity; and\n• Volunteer.\nEngaging the Whole Community\nFEMA’s Whole Community approach to emergency management seeks to engage the\nfull capacity of society in a dialogue to increase disaster preparedness and resilience.\nThe full capacity of society is a reference to all of the partners within a community who\nshould engage in community preparedness, including government entities; non-\ngovernmental organizations; faith-based organizations; schools; nonprofit groups;\nprivate sector entities; and at the grass roots level, individuals, families, local\ncommunities, and social networks.\nCommunity coalitions organized collaborative bodies within a community such as\nCitizen Corps help to foster and strengthen relationships throughout the community.\nRelationships are the fabric that makes a community stronger and more resilient after\nAugust 2019 Page 1-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\ndisasters. Social capital is the value we place on our relationships with one another.\nStudies have shown that communities that possess a high amount of social capital\nbounce back much more efficiently after a disaster and tend to rely less on outside\nresources to return to normal.\nDespite advances in technology, a functioning community is based on complex and\ninterdependent systems driven by human forces. Community coalitions bring\ngovernment and community leaders together to ensure emergency plans more\neffectively reflect the community’s needs, challenges, capabilities, and resources.\nGet Involved\nPreparedness requires active participation from all. Below are some steps to get\ninvolved.\n• Start the process by talking to your friends and family about the hazards in your\narea and discuss what steps—large or small—you all need to take to be able to\nhelp each other in a crisis.\n• Ask about emergency planning at your workplace, schools, places of worship,\nand other social settings.\n• Make sure those individuals in charge have a plan and are connected to\ncommunity authorities on emergency management and planning.\n• Take training to acquire the skills you need to help others and keep your skills\ncurrent through refresher training and practice.\n• Participate in the CERT program to provide training, practice, and the connection\nwith others to develop teams.\n• Plan to participate in drills and exercises with your family and neighbors and at\nyour workplace, school, place of worship, and community-organized events. The\nmore you practice, the better prepared you will be to take effective action when a\ndisaster happens.\n• Talk to your friends and family about volunteering. Volunteering to help your\ncommunity through CERT and other activities is a great experience to share!\nAugust 2019 Page 1-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: HAZARDS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT\nTypes of Disasters\nDisasters can be:\n• Natural (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, floods, extreme heat, hurricanes, landslides,\nthunderstorms, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, winter storms);\n• Technological and Accidental (e.g., hazardous material spill, nuclear power plant\naccident);\n• Terrorism (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive weapons);\n• Pandemics; and\n• Home Fires.\nCERT volunteers will generally respond to large-scale events in their communities. The\nscope of this CERT training does not cover pandemics. While home fires are not always\ncommunity events, Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls, does discuss them. For the\npurposes of this training, most of the hazards discussed will be natural, technological\nand accidental, or terrorism related.\nKey Elements of Disasters\nRegardless of the event, disasters have several key elements in common.\n• They are relatively unexpected, with the little or no warning or opportunity to\nprepare.\n• Increased demands for resources may initially overwhelm available response\npersonnel and emergency services.\n• They endanger lives, health, and the environment.\nIn the immediate aftermath of a disaster, needs are often greater than professional\nemergency services personnel can provide. In these instances, CERTs become a vital\nlink in the emergency service chain.\nUnderstanding Local Hazard Vulnerability\nAssessing your community’s vulnerability to hazards allows the community to prioritize\npreparedness measures and to target effective actions for the appropriate hazard. To\nassess your community’s vulnerability to hazards, it is useful to:\n• Identify the most common disasters that occur;\n• Identify possible hazards with most severe impact;\n• Consider recent and/or historical impacts;\n• Identify susceptible locations in the community for specific hazards—people,\nbuildings, infrastructure; and\n• Consider what to expect for disruption of services and length of restoration.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nImpact on Infrastructure\nInfrastructure and essential service providers that enable our communities to thrive and\ngrow have become increasingly interconnected. Impacts in one area often affect\nessential government services, businesses, and individuals in an entire region with far-\nreaching health, safety, economic, and environmental consequences (see Table 1.1).\nTable 1.1: Examples of Possible Impact on Infrastructure\nInfrastructure at Risk Possible Impacts\n• Roads are closed and/or impassable\n• Responders may be delayed in reaching areas of\nTransportation need\n• Flow of needed supplies (e.g., food, water) is\ninterrupted\n• Damaged critical facilities (e.g., hospitals, fire stations,\nStructures police precincts, airports) unable to function\n• Increased risk of damage from falling debris\n• Survivors unable to phone for help or reach service\nproviders\nCommunications Systems\n• Coordination of services is hampered\n• Families and friends cannot communicate\n• Loss of service\nUtilities • Increased risk of fire or electrical shock\n• Limited access to fuel (e.g., pumps that may not work)\n• Medical facilities hampered\n• Inadequate water flow, which results in notice to boil\nWater Service\nwater and hampered firefighting capabilities\n• Increased risk to public health\n• Increased risk of fire or explosion from fuel line\nFuel Supplies rupture\n• Flow of fuel is interrupted by impassable roads\n• ATMs do not work\nFinancial Services\n• Credit card systems inoperable\nConsequences of Damage to Infrastructure\nEach instance of damage to infrastructure may severely restrict the abilities of police,\nfire, and emergency medical services in that disaster. During a disaster, hospital\nemergency room personnel prioritize resources based on the severity of each injury. For\nemergency room personnel, life-threatening injuries take the highest priority and they\nAugust 2019 Page 1-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\ntreat them first. In the same way, during or after a disaster, emergency services\npersonnel must prioritize resources according to the highest-priority need.\n• Police will address incidents of grave public safety.\n• Firefighters will suppress major fires.\n• EMS personnel will handle life-threatening injuries. You should be aware,\nhowever, that CERTs may also handle life-threatening injuries until EMS units\nbecome available.\n• Lower-priority needs will be met in other ways.\nDamage Related to Structure Type\nIt is important to know what type of damage to expect from the main types of structures\nin the community. Engineered buildings, such as most high-rise buildings, have\nperformed well in most types of disasters. During earthquakes, flooding events (e.g.,\nhurricanes, tsunamis), and high-wind events (e.g., tornadoes, hurricanes), older high-\nrise buildings, however, are more susceptible to damage from:\n• Broken glass;\n• Falling panels; and\n• Collapsing walkways and stairways.\nKeep in mind that age, type of construction, and type of disaster are major factors in\npotential damage to detached homes and garages.\n• Tornado and hurricane damage to single-family homes can range from little\ndamage to total destruction.\n• In general, homes built prior to 1940 were not originally bolted to the foundation,\nmaking them subject to being shaken, blown, or floated off their foundations.\n• Older homes constructed of non-reinforced brick are less stable than newer\nconstruction.\n• When an event damages a structure, there is a threat of additional damage, such\nas fire from ruptured gas lines, following the event.\n• Mobile homes are most susceptible to damage because they can be displaced.\nWhen displacement occurs, structural integrity becomes questionable and utility\nconnections may be damaged, increasing the risk of fire and electric shock.\nIn multiple-unit dwellings, there is often a main utility shutoff for the entire building, as\nwell as a shutoff located within each individual unit. Depending on the situation at hand,\nyou may need to use one or both. Be mindful of the effects and consequences of using\neach (Unit 6 will cover utility control in more depth).\nMultiple-Use Buildings\nMultiple-use buildings with oversized roof spans have a greater risk of collapse and\nbroken glass in a disaster. These include:\n• Airports;\n• Malls and strip malls;\n• Places of worship;\n• Sports arenas; and\n• Warehouse-type structures.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nNon-Structural Hazards\nThere is also a risk in all types of structures from fixtures and other items within a home,\ngarage, or workplace, that can pose a hazard during or after a disaster, including:\n• Gas line ruptures from water heaters or ranges displaced by shaking, water, or\nwind;\n• Damage from falling books, dishes, or other cabinet contents;\n• Risk of injury or electric shock from displaced appliances and office equipment;\nand/or\n• Fire from faulty wiring, overloaded plugs, frayed electrical cords.\nReducing hazards is an important part of personal preparedness. It is also important to\nknow how and when to turn off utilities safely. Unit 6 – Fire Safety and Utility Control will\ncover utility shutoffs.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: HOME AND WORKPLACE PREPAREDNESS\nFEMA is committed to social and physical science as the foundation for increasing\nindividual and community preparedness. The agency has conducted national household\nsurveys to assess the public’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on preparing for a\nrange of hazards since 2007. The 2015 National Household Survey included key\nfindings on individual preparedness, and in general, the preparedness concepts relayed\nthroughout the CERT Basic Training.\n• 68 percent of respondents reported having enough supplies to get through three\ndays.\n• 63 percent of respondents reported having taken steps to safeguard critical\ndocuments.\n• 39 percent of respondents reported having sought preparedness information\nwithin the past year.\n• 27 percent of respondents reported having talked to others about getting\nprepared within the past year.\n• 18 percent of respondents reported having attended a preparedness\nmeeting/training within the past year.\nPreparing for a Disaster\nMany preparedness actions are useful in any type of emergency, and some are specific\nto the type of disaster. A critical first step to preparedness is to understand the hazard\nor hazards that are most relevant to your community. Next, it is important to learn about\nlocal alerts and warning systems, evacuation routes, and sheltering plans. It is also\nimportant to familiarize yourself with hazards in other areas given that you may\nexperience a different and less familiar type of hazard when you are traveling.\nRegardless of the type of disaster, important elements of disaster preparedness\ninclude:\n• Having the skills to evaluate the situation quickly and to take effective action to\nprotect yourself;\n• Having a family disaster plan and practicing the plan with drills;\n• Assembling supplies in multiple locations;\n• Reducing the impact of hazards through mitigation practices; and\n• Getting involved by participating in training and volunteer programs.\nIt is always important to address specific needs, including any access or functional\nneeds, considerations for pets and service animals, and transportation requirements for\nyou and your family and friends. More information on preparedness is available online\n(see Table 1.2).\nAugust 2019 Page 1-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nWebsites of Interest\nTable 2.2: Preparedness Websites\nOrganization URL Description\nhttps://www.ready.gov/community- Resources, trainings, and information\nemergency-response-team about the CERT program.\nFEMA’s national website for disaster\npreparedness. Provides excellent,\nwww.ready/gov/\ngeneral advice and is a good place to\nstart.\nPrepareathon is a grassroots\nwww.community.fema.gov campaign to increase community\npreparedness and resilience.\nThe American Red Cross website is\nfull of excellent tips and information\nrelated to most of the natural disasters\nwww.redcross.org\nthat occur, including a few topics not\ncovered at FEMA’s Ready.gov\nwebsite.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) established this\nwww.pandemicflu.gov\nwebsite as a hub for national\ninformation on pandemic influenza.\nFamily Disaster Plan\nIn addition to knowing immediate protective actions that you may need to take, you\nshould also create a family disaster plan. These plans can mean the difference\nbetween life and death in a disaster. Important considerations for your family disaster\nplan include:\n• Where will you meet family members? You should have a location outside the\nhouse and another location outside the neighborhood;\n• Identify an out-of-state “check-in contact;”\n• Plan for all possibilities—extended stay, sheltering in place, or evacuation;\n• How you will escape buildings where you spend time—your home, workplace,\nschool, and place of worship; and\n• What route (and several alternatives) will you use to evacuate?\n• Do you have transportation?\nAugust 2019 Page 1-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nFamily safety is the most important factor when a disaster strikes. To make the most\ninformed decision regarding your family’s safety, you should first consider what option\nis best given the situation. It is also essential to practice your plan with your family—\nsuch as evacuating the home and contacting all family members using your “check-in\ncontact.” Practicing your plan now will improve your performance when it matters most.\nCreating a Family Disaster Plan\nTo get started…\n• Contact your local emergency management office and your local chapter of the\nAmerican Red Cross.\nFind out which disasters are most likely to happen in your community.\n-\nAsk how you would receive warnings about the event.\n-\nFind out how to prepare for each type of disaster.\n-\n• Meet with your family.\nDiscuss the types of disasters that could occur.\n-\nExplain how to prepare and respond.\n-\nDiscuss what to do if advised to evacuate.\n-\nPractice what you have discussed.\n-\n• Plan how your family will stay in contact if separated by a disaster.\nPick two meeting places: 1) a location a safe distance from your home in\n-\ncase of fire and 2) a place outside your neighborhood in case you cannot\nreturn home.\nChoose an out-of-state friend as a “check-in contact” for everyone to call.\n-\n• Make sure the person selected understands that they are your out-\nof-state contact in case of emergency and what you would expect\nof them should such an emergency arise.\n• Give your “check-in contact” person a list of pertinent people to\ncontact. Be sure to include phone numbers!\n• Periodically practice using your local and out-of-state contacts as if\nit were an emergency.\nPrepare a business-card size list of family and friends’ phone numbers\n-\nand print one for each family member.\n• FEMA developed the Family Communications Plan to consolidate\nimportant contact information for emergencies. The two-page plan\nincludes double-sided card printouts you can use for this purpose.\n• As a security measure, do not specify relationships.\n• Complete the following steps:\nPost emergency telephone numbers by every home phone and save in\n-\nevery cell phone.\nShow responsible family members how and when to shut off water, gas,\n-\nand electricity at main switches.\nInstall a smoke alarm on each level of your home, especially near\n-\nbedrooms, and a carbon monoxide alarm in or near every bedroom. Test\nthem monthly and change the batteries when you change your clocks in\nthe spring and fall.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\n• Contact your local fire department to learn about home fire hazards.\n• Learn first aid and CPR.\nContact your local chapter of the American Red Cross, American Heart\n-\nAssociation, or National Safety Council for information and training.\n• Meet with your neighbors.\nPlan how the neighborhood could work together after a disaster; know\n-\nyour neighbors’ skills (e.g., medical, technical) and work with other\ncommunity partners.\nConsider how you could help neighbors, including the elderly or\n-\nindividuals who have access or functional needs.\nMake plans for childcare in case parents cannot get home.\n-\nAssembling and Storing Disaster Supplies\nYou can cope best by preparing for a disaster before it strikes. One way to prepare is to\nassemble disaster supplies in multiple locations. After disaster strikes, you may not\nhave time to shop or search for supplies. If you have gathered supplies in advance, you\nand your family can endure an evacuation or home confinement.\nTo Prepare Your Disaster Supply Kit\n1. Review the checklists on the next few pages.\n2. Gather the supplies from the list. Remember that many of the items needed for\nyour kits are already in your household. It is possible to assemble these items in\nappropriate locations for quick access in an emergency but use under normal\ncircumstances whenever needed. For example, keep a wrench in your kit to shut\noff gas at the meter in an emergency, but also use the wrench for everyday\ntasks. Just be sure to return it to the emergency kit.\n3. Place the supplies you are likely to need for an evacuation in an easy-to-carry\ncontainer. These supplies are listed with an asterisk (*).\nNotes Regarding Your Disaster Supply Kit:\nWater\n• Store water in plastic containers such as soft drink bottles.\n• Look for the triangular recycling symbol with a number 1 on the bottom of the\nbottle, as those are best for water storage. Avoid using containers that will\ndegrade quickly or break, such as milk jugs or glass bottles.\n• Wash the bottle with soap and warm water, fill with water from your tap, and\nstore in a cool, dark area away from direct sunlight.\n• Replace your emergency water every six months by repeating the process as all\nplastic degrades over time.\n• Keep in mind that a normally active person needs to drink at least 2 quarts of\nwater each day. Hot environments and intense physical activity can double that\nrequirement. Children, nursing mothers, and ill people will need more.\n• Store at least 1 gallon of water per person, per day (3 quarts for drinking, 1 quart\nfor food preparation and sanitation).*\nAugust 2019 Page 1-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\n• Keep at least a 3-day supply of water for each person in your household.\nIf you have questions about the quality of the water, purify it before drinking. You can\nheat water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or use commercial purification tablets to purify\nthe water. You can also use regular household liquid chlorine bleach if it is pure 5.25 –\n6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite (see Table 1.3). (Do not use perfumed bleach!) After\nadding bleach, shake or stir the water container and let it stand 30 minutes before\ndrinking.\nTable 3.3: Ratios for Purifying Water with Bleach\nWater Quantity Bleach Added\n1 quart 4 drops\n1 gallon 8 drops\n4 gallons 1/3 teaspoon\n*Note: If water is cloudy, double the recommended amount of bleach.\nFood and Kitchen Items\nStore at least a 3-day supply of nonperishable food. Select foods that require no\nrefrigeration, preparation, or cooking and little or no water. If you must heat food, pack a\ncan of solid gel fuel. Select food items that are compact and lightweight. Avoid salty\nfoods if possible as they increase thirst. Table 1.4 includes a selection of foods to\ninclude in your disaster kit. Check expiration dates biannually.\nFirst Aid Kit*\nAssemble a first aid kit for your home and one for each car. (*Note: This kit should not\nsupplement or replace a CERT member supply kit!)\nSpecial Items\nRemember family members with special needs, such as infants and elderly or those\nwith access and functional needs.\nGeneral\nSupplies marked with an asterisk (*) can also be used for evacuation.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nTable 4.4: Disaster Supply Items\nFood Items\n• Ready-to-eat canned meats, fruits, • High-energy foods (Peanut butter, jelly,\nand vegetables crackers, granola bars, trail mix)\n• Canned, juices, milk, soup (if • Foods for infants, elderly persons, or\npowdered, store extra water) persons on special diets\n• Sugar, salt, pepper • Comfort and stress foods (Cookies,\nhard candy, sweetened cereals,\nlollipops, instant coffee, tea bags)\nKitchen Items\n• Manual can opener • Trash bags\n• Mess kits or paper cups, plates, and • Household liquid bleach to treat\nplastic utensils drinking water\n• All-purpose knife • Aluminum foil and plastic wrap\n• Small cooking stove and a can of\ncooking fuel\nDisaster Kit First Aid Items\n• First aid manual • Four-inch sterile gauze pads (4-6)\n• Two-inch sterile gauze pads (4-6) • Triangular bandages (3)\n• Hypoallergenic adhesive tape • Moistened towelettes\n• Needle • Thermometer\n• Antibacterial ointment • Tube of petroleum jelly or other\n• Tongue depressors (2) lubricant\n• Assorted sizes of safety pins • Cleaning agent/soap\n• Non-latex exam gloves (2 pairs) • Cotton balls\n• Four-inch sterile roller bandages (3 • Three-inch sterile roller bandages (3\n• rolls) rolls)\n• Sunscreen • Scissors\n• Tweezers • Hot and cold compress\n• Aspirin or non-aspirin pain reliever • Anti-diarrhea medication\n• Antacid (for upset stomach) • Allergy medication and, if necessary,\n• Laxative epinephrine\n• Sterile adhesive bandages in assorted • Activated charcoal\nsizes\nAugust 2019 Page 1-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nDisaster Kit Tools\n• Emergency preparedness manual* • Non-sparking shutoff wrench to turn off\n• Battery-operated weather radio and household gas and water\nextra batteries • Pliers\n• Tube tent • Compass*\n• Duct tape • Fire extinguisher (small canister, ABC\n• Matches in a waterproof container type)\n• Plastic storage containers • Signal flare(s)*\n• Paper, pencil* • Needles, thread\n• Work gloves • Medicine dropper\n• Flashlight and extra batteries* • Whistle\n• Fuel for vehicle and generator • Landline telephone\n• Plastic sheeting\nPersonal Sanitation Items\n• Toilet paper, towelettes* • Soap, liquid detergent*\n• Feminine supplies* • Personal hygiene items*\n• Household chlorine bleach • Plastic bucket with tight lid\n• Disinfectant • Liquid hand sanitizer\n• Plastic garbage bags, ties\nPet Items\n• Medication and medical records • Food, potable water, bowls, cat litter,\n(stored in a waterproof container) pan, can opener\n• Current photos of your pet in case • Pet beds and toys, if easily\nthey get lost transportable\n• The name and number of your • Information on feeding schedules,\nveterinarian in case you have to foster medical conditions, and behavior\nor board your pets problems\n• Sturdy leashes, harnesses, and/or • Pet first aid kit\ncarriers to transport pets safely and\nensure that your animals can’t escape\nClothing and Bedding Supplies\n• Sturdy shoes or boots* • Rain gear*\n• Blankets or sleeping bags* • Hats and gloves*\n• Thermal underwear • Sunglasses*\n• One complete change of clothing and • Remember to cycle clothing for\nfootwear per person different seasons\nAugust 2019 Page 1-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nHousehold Documents and Contact Numbers\n• Personal identification, cash (including • Emergency contact list and other\nchange) or traveler’s checks, and a important phone numbers\ncredit card • Map of the area and phone numbers of\n• Physical and electronic copies of places you could go\nimportant documents: birth • Copies of prescriptions and/or original\ncertificates, marriage certificate, prescription bottles\ndriver’s license, Social Security cards,\npassports, wills, deeds, inventory of\nhousehold goods, insurance papers,\ncontracts, immunization records, bank\nand credit card account numbers, and\nstocks and bonds.

As part of your escape plan you should:\n• Consider the needs of children and individuals with access and functional needs;\n• Inform all family members or office coworkers of the plan; and\n• Run practice escape drills.\nThe following figure shows an example of an escape plan.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nImage 1.1: Escape Plan\nSample family escape plan with arrows showing an escape route from every room in the home\nand a family meeting place outside the home\nIn most cases, homeowners will not have smoke alarms in every room, but it is\nimportant to have a smoke alarm at least on every level of the house. Practice your\nplans after you develop them. Conduct family fire drills, follow the local evacuation\nroutes, and locate the nearest shelter to ensure that when a disaster occurs, you know\nwhat to do.\nExercise 1.2: Evacuate!\nInstructions: Take the scenario given and decide what things to bring with you and/or\nwhat to do in the time available.\nProtective Actions\nBecause many disasters occur with little or no warning, individuals need to have the\nknowledge and skills to take immediate protective actions in the first critical moments\nafter a disaster has occurred—before you have instruction from authorities. While the\nspecific actions to take are based on a number of variables (e.g., disaster type, amount\nof warning, amount of training you have taken, and location), the following list provides\nan overview of protective actions for which you should be familiar. These should be your\nobjectives in assessing your post-event environment.\n• Assess the situation. When something occurs without notice, it is important to\ntake a few seconds to assess the situation to determine your most effective next\nsteps, including identifying the type of event and determining whether the event\nhas compromised air quality or a building structure.\n• Decide to stay or change locations. In some instances, you should stay where\nyou are (e.g., if you are inside and an event has occurred outside, you may need\nto stay inside) and in other circumstances you should change location (e.g., if\nAugust 2019 Page 1-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nyou are inside and the event is inside, you may need to evacuate the building).\nAll disasters have unique attributes, so it is important for you to realize you may\nneed to evaluate the circumstances to determine the best course of action\n• Staying or changing location is a critical early decision in disasters. If you\nare not in immediate danger, you should stay where you are and get more\ninformation before taking your next steps. Thinking through the likely hazards in\nyour community and where you might be when an event occurs may help you\nvisualize your response. Additionally, consider your own circumstances and\nthose of your household. Elderly persons or individuals with access and\nfunctional needs may need to evacuate well in advance of official notice or before\nthe situation turns dangerous. While you may need to make the first immediate\ndecision to stay inside or go outside or to shelter in place by sealing a room\nwithout authoritative instruction, it is important to listen to local authorities when\nthey provide that information. If experts or local officials tell you to evacuate from\nyour location, LEAVE!\n• Seek clean air and protect breathing passages. Regardless of the type of\ndisaster, clean air is a critical need. Actions to protect your breathing passages\nand to seek clean air may include covering your mouth with a cloth or mask,\nvacating the building, or sheltering in place by sealing an internal room while the\nairborne contaminant dissipates.\n• Protect yourself from debris and signal rescuers if trapped. Protecting\nyourself from falling or precarious debris is an essential protective action. If\ntrapped, protect your airways, bang on an object, or blow a whistle. Yelling\nshould be a last resort.\n• Remove contaminants. If contaminants are released into the area or you\nencounter liquid or solid contaminants, quickly remove contaminated clothing\nbefore washing yourself with soap and water, starting at the head and working\ntoward the feet.\n• Practice good hygiene. Good hygiene is a preventive measure for spreading\ndisease, and it is important to be mindful of hygiene in a post disaster\nenvironment. Clean drinking water and sanitation are important protective\nactions.\nSheltering\nThere are different types of sheltering, and each are appropriate for different disasters.\n• Shelter in place: Sealing a room is a way to protect yourself from contaminants\nin the air for a short period until the contaminants dissipate. You should identify\nan internal room in your home, at work, or other locations where you spend a\ngreat deal of time. If you are required to shelter in place, you will be in this room\nfor only a few hours, but it is important that you be able to seal the room quickly.\nStoring specific items in the room is helpful. You should have snacks and water,\na battery-operated radio, a flashlight, and pre-cut plastic sheeting and duct tape\nto seal off vents and door and window openings.\n• Shelter for extended stay: Sheltering for an extended stay means you would\nstay where you are for several days or, in the case of a pandemic, authorities\nAugust 2019 Page 1-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nmay ask you to limit your time outside the home for up to two weeks. It is\nimportant to store emergency supplies for these possibilities.\n• Mass care/community shelter: These shelters often provide water, food,\nmedicine, and basic sanitary facilities but, if possible, you should take your three-\nday disaster supplies kit with you so that you will be sure to have the supplies\nyou require.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: REDUCING THE IMPACT OF HAZARDS THROUGH\nMITIGATION\nMitigation\nAssembling disaster supplies and having a family disaster plan will help reduce the\nimpact a disaster may have on you and your family. Mitigation is another approach you\ncan take. Mitigation is the reduction of loss of life and property by lessening the impact\nof disasters. Mitigation includes any activities that prevent an emergency, reduce the\nlikelihood of occurrence, or reduce the damaging effects of unavoidable hazards. A few\nexamples include purchasing appropriate insurance and taking structural and\nnonstructural measures.\nYou should ensure your homeowner’s policy provide adequate coverage and covers\nappropriate hazards for your area. Homeowner’s insurance does not cover damage\ncaused by flooding, so it is important to know whether you are in a flood hazard zone. If\nyou are, it is strongly advised to purchase flood insurance. Visit the National Flood\nInsurance Program website, www.Floodsmart.gov, to learn more.\nSome mitigation measures require a bigger investment to address structural changes to\nreduce the impact of disasters (see Table 1.5). Other non-structural mitigation\nmeasures may include relatively simple actions you can take to prevent home\nfurnishings and appliances from causing damage or injuries during any event that might\ncause them to shift.\nTable 5.5: Home Mitigation Measures\nType of Hazard Sample Precautions\n• Bolt older houses to the foundation\n• Install trusses or hurricane straps to reinforce the roof\n• Strap propane tanks and chimneys\nStructural • Strap mobile homes to their concrete pads\n• Raise utilities (above the level of flood risk)\n• Ask a professional to check the foundation, roof connectors,\nchimney, etc.\n• Anchor furniture (e.g., bookshelves, hutches, grandfather\nclocks) to the wall\n• Secure appliances and office equipment in place with\nindustrial strength hook and loop fasteners\n• Secure cabinet doors with childproof fasteners\nNon-Structural • Locate and label shutoffs for gas, electricity, and water\nbefore disasters occur. After a disaster, shut off the utilities\nas needed to prevent fires and other risks\n• Teach all home occupants, including children who are old\nenough to handle the responsibility, when and how to shut\noff the important utilities\nAugust 2019 Page 1-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nType of Hazard Sample Precautions\n• Secure water heaters to the wall to safeguard against\nruptured gas line or loose electrical wires\n• Install hurricane storm shutters to protect windows\nPlease note, a safe room is NOT the same as a shelter-in-place location. A safe room\nrequires significant fortification for the room to provide protection against extremely high\nwinds. More information regarding safe rooms is available at www.fema.gov/safe-\nrooms.\nSheltering-in-place protects you from contaminants in the air. To shelter in place, you do\nnot need to alter the structure of the room. You are simply sealing the room with plastic\nsheeting and duct tape for a short time while the contaminants in the air dissipate.\nFortifying Your Home\nRemember that different non-structural hazards pose different threats, depending on\nthe disaster, as outlined by the following examples.\n• Home Fires\nMake sure that burglar bars and locks on outside window entries are easy\n-\nto open from the inside.\n• Landslides\nInstall flexible pipefittings to avoid gas or water leaks; flexible fittings are\n-\nmore resistant to breakage.\n• Wildfires\nAvoid using wooden shakes and shingles for roofing.\n-\nClear all flammable vegetation at least 30 feet from the home.\n-\nRemove vines from the walls of the home.\n-\nPlace propane tanks at least 30 feet from the home or other structures.\n-\nStack firewood at least 30 feet away and uphill from the home.\n-\nFor more information: “Learn About the Different Types of Disasters and Hazards” at\nwww.fema.gov/hazard/index.shtm.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-22\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 6: CERT DISASTER RESPONSE\nAs described earlier in this unit, CERTs respond in the period immediately after a\ndisaster when response resources are overwhelmed or delayed. CERTs assist\nemergency response personnel when requested in accordance with standard operating\nprocedures developed by the sponsoring agency. Working as a team, members assume\nsome of the same functions as emergency response personnel. As a reminder, while\nCERTs are a valuable asset in emergency response. CERTs are not trained to perform\nall of the functions or respond to the same degree as professional responders. CERTs\nare a bridge to professional responders until they arrive. CERTs respond after a\ndisaster by:\n• Treating life-threatening injuries until professional assistance is available;\n• Helping disaster survivors cope with their emotional stressors;\n• Locating and turning off utilities, if safe to do so;\n• Extinguishing small fires; and\n• Conducting light search and rescue operations.\nThere is a distinction between how a CERT volunteer responds to a disaster as an\nindividual and how that volunteer responds as part of a team. In all instances, it is\ncritical for CERT volunteers to stay within the limits of their training when providing\ndisaster relief.\nA CERT volunteer’s first responsibility is personal and family safety. Only after CERT\nvolunteers have secured their personal and family safety is it possible and pertinent to\nrespond in a group capacity to do what is necessary for the community as a whole.\nThe sponsoring agency orchestrates its group response. In general, the team members\nselect a leader (and alternate) and define the meeting location—or staging area—they\nwill use in the event of disaster.\nCERT volunteers gather at the pre-established staging area to organize and receive\ntasking assignments. Leaders may identify “runners” to serve as a communication link\nbetween the staging area and CERT volunteers working in the field.\nIn some cases, CERT volunteers also provide a well-trained workforce for such duties\nthat entail shelter support, crowd and traffic management, and evacuation. It is\nimportant to note that when you become a CERT volunteer, you do not give up any\nrights you have as United States citizen. You can take the same legally permissible\nactions you would as an individual, but certain restrictions apply when acting as a CERT\nvolunteer. When you put on the green CERT vest, you represent the agency or group\nthat sponsored you.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-23\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nCERT Organization\nThe chart below shows the basic CERT structure, including four sections. No matter\nwhich function CERT volunteers are assigned to, effective CERTs require teamwork.\nThere are checklists in the Additional Materials section at the back of Unit 1 in the\nParticipant Manual that will help in:\n• Planning and organizing a CERT; and\n• Assembling equipment and supplies for a CERT.\nCERT organization will be covered more in-depth in Unit 2: CERT Organization\nImage 1.2: CERT Organization\n• CERT organization showing the government agency liaison at the top.\n• Underneath is the CERT Incident Commander/Team Leader who directs the\nactivities of the four sections: Operations, Planning, Logistics, and\nAdministration.\n• Underneath the Operations section are three response teams: Fire Suppression,\nSearch and Rescue, and Medical.\n• Underneath the Planning section are two sections: Documentation and Incident\nStatus.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-24\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nRemember that, at all times, a CERT volunteer’s first job is to stay safe.\nIt is important to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). CERT\nvolunteers are required to wear the following:\n• Helmet;\n• Goggles;\n• N95 Mask;\n• Gloves (work and non-latex exam); and\n• Sturdy shoes or boots.\nCERT in Action\nAcross the country, CERTs continue to be activated in a wide range of disaster and\nemergency support operations. For these efforts, CERT volunteers and teams are\nreceiving federal, state, and local recognition for their response assistance. For brief\nprofiles on how CERTs have assisted in actual emergencies all over the country visit\nthe national CERT website, www.ready.gov/community-emergencyresponse-team.\nCERTs in Non-Disaster Roles\nCERT volunteers are also a potential volunteer pool for the community. They can help\nwith non-emergency projects such as:\n• Identifying and aiding neighbors and coworkers who might need assistance\nduring an emergency or disaster;\n• Distributing preparedness materials and conducting preparedness\ndemonstrations;\n• Staffing first aid booths and preparedness displays at health fairs, county fairs,\nand other special events;\n• Assisting with the installation of smoke alarms for seniors and special needs\nhouseholds; and\n• Assisting with traffic and crowd management at large community events.\nBy participating in non-emergency community projects, CERT volunteers build\nrecognition for the CERT program within their community and raise overall awareness\nof community preparedness. These events also provide CERT volunteers with valuable\npractice using the Incident Command System and operating with a partner.\nProtection for Disaster Workers\n“Good Samaritan” laws generally protect CERT volunteers who provide care in a\nprudent and reasonable manner.\nThe Volunteer Protection Act (VPA) of 1997 is a Federal law that protects volunteers\nfrom liability as long as they are acting in accordance with the training that they have\nreceived.

Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 2: OVERVIEW\nSetting the Stage\nThis Unit will cover the Incident Command Structure (ICS) in depth and how it\napplies to CERT programs. It is recommended, although not required, that course\nparticipants have completed the IS-100 (Introduction to Incident Command System)\nand IS-700 (Introduction to National Incident Management System [NIMS]) courses\nprior to the start of this Unit.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Describe the CERT organizational structure;\n2. Explain the ICS and how CERT operates within this structure;\n3. Describe the 9-step On-Scene size-up process; and\n4. Describe how to use CERT standard documents.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: CERT ORGANIZATION\nPrinciples of On-scene Management\nCERT organization is based on the Incident Command System (ICS), which is a proven\nmanagement system used by emergency responders. On-Scene management in a\ndisaster situation follows these principles:\n• Maintain the safety of disaster workers. The CERT Team Leader (TL) must\ncontinually prioritize response activities based on the team’s capability and\ntraining. TLs also maintain the principle that rescuer safety is the number one\nconcern. CERT functional leadership assigns activities and accounts for team\nvolunteers. CERT volunteers work in the buddy system and respond based on\ntheir size-up of the situations that they encounter.\n• Provide clear leadership and organizational structure by developing a chain of\ncommand and roles that are known by all team volunteers. Each CERT member\nhas only one person that he or she takes direction from and responds to.\n• Improve the effectiveness of rescue efforts. Disaster information is collected, and\nresponses are prioritized based on rescuer safety and doing the greatest good\nfor the greatest number according to the team’s capabilities and training.\nCERT Application of On-Scene Management\nThe specific CERT organizational structure and protocols provide:\n• A well-defined management structure (e.g., leadership, functional areas,\nreporting chain, working in teams);\n• A manageable span of control that provides for a desirable rescuer-to-supervisor\nratio, optimum 5-to-1 with an acceptable spread of 2-to-7;\n• Common terminology that contributes to effective communication and shared\nunderstanding;\n• Effective communication among team volunteers and with professional\nresponders, including the use of radios;\n• Consolidated action plans that coordinate strategic goals, tactical objectives, and\nsupport activities;\n• Comprehensive resource management that facilitates application of available\nresources to the incident in a timely manner; and\n• Accountability.\nObjectives for CERT On-Scene Management\nIn a disaster situation, the CERT TL:\n• Identifies the scope of the incident (e.g., What is the problem?);\n• Determines an overall strategy (e.g., What can we do, and how will we do it?);\n• Deploys teams and resources (e.g., Who is going to do what?); and\n• Documents actions and results.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nThe Need for Flexibility\nDisasters create a dynamic, ever-changing environment. The CERT organizational\nframework is flexible so that it can expand or contract depending on the ongoing\nassessment priorities determined by the CERT Team Leader, people, and resources\navailable. This expansion and contraction help ensure:\n• Rescuer safety;\n• Doing the greatest good for the greatest number;\n• A manageable span of control; and\n• Accountability of CERT volunteers.\nIncident Command System\nThe ICS is the system used by emergency response agencies to manage emergency\noperations. When a CERT activates, it becomes part of that system. This section will\nexplain the ICS format and detail how CERTs both operate within the ICS and organize\nthemselves to replicate that of the ICS structure.\nBasic ICS structure for a CERT is established by the person who arrives first on the\nscene. This person becomes the TL. Initially, the TL may handle all of the command\npositions of the ICS but, as the incident evolves, he or she may assign personnel as\nneeded to the ICS Command Functions:\n• Operations Section Chief;\n• Intelligence/Investigations Section Chief;\n• Planning Section Chief;\n• Logistics Section Chief; and\n• Finance/Administration Section Chief.\nThrough an effective ICS, all CERT volunteers report through a chain of command to\nthe TL. The TL reports to the first fire or law enforcement official at their location and\ntakes direction from that person until otherwise directed or until the CERT is relieved.\nImage 2.1: ICS Command Function Organization Chart\nAugust 2019 Page 2-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nAlthough there are a number of detailed responsibilities under each ICS function, the\nsystem itself is easy to understand. CERTs will typically require the Operations,\nPlanning, and Logistics functions. The CERT Team Leader is responsible for handling\nor delegating each function to team volunteers.\nAs the incident expands, CERT volunteers are assigned or re-assigned to each section\nto handle specific aspects of the response while maintaining an effective span of\ncontrol.\n• CERT Team Leader:\n― Ensures incident safety;\n― Establishes incident objectives;\n― Delegates authority to others;\n― Provides information to internal and external parties;\n― Establishes and maintains liaison with other responders (e.g., fire, law\nenforcement, public works, other CERTs); and\n― Takes direction from agency officials.\n• Intelligence/Investigations Section:\n― Prevents and deters potential unlawful activity, incidents, and/or attacks;\n― Collects, processes, analyzes, secures, and appropriately disseminates\ninformation and intelligence;\n― Conducts investigations; and\n― Informs and supports life safety operations.\nIntelligence/Investigations is a function in the formal Incident Command System;\nhowever, CERTs will have a very limited involvement, if any, with this function.\n• Planning Section:\n― Tracks resource status (e. g., number of CERT volunteers who have\n“reported for duty”);\n― Tracks situation status;\n― Prepares the Team’s action plan;\n― Develops alternative strategies; and\n― Provides documentation services.\n• Logistics Section:\n― Provides communications;\n― Provides food and medical support to Team volunteers;\n― Manages supplies and facilities; and\n― Make sure that there are adequate resources (e.g., personnel, supplies,\nand equipment) for meeting the incident objectives.\n• Finance and Administration Section:\n― Conducts contract negotiation and monitoring;\n― Keeps track of timekeeping;\n― Provides cost analysis; and\n― Tracks compensation for injury or damage to property.\nFinance and Administration is a function in the formal Incident Command System;\nhowever, CERTs will have very limited involvement, if any, with this function.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nCERT Operations\nBased on the principles of ICS, CERTs follow these protocols:\n• Each CERT must establish a command structure.\n• The CERT TL directs team activities. During activation for a disaster, the first\nperson at a pre-designated staging area assumes this responsibility. The initial\nTL may hand off this role to a pre-designated leader when that person arrives.\n• The location established by the CERT TL as the central point for command and\ncontrol of the incident is called the Command Post for the CERT. The TL stays in\nthe Command Post. If the TL has to leave, the responsibility of TL must be\ndelegated to someone in the Command Post.\nUsing the ICS structure, CERT volunteers are assigned to assist with a range of\nfunctions including:\n• Logistics—managing resources, services, and supplies;\n• Planning/Intelligence—collecting and displaying information; collecting and\ncompiling documentation; and\n• Operations—conducting fire suppression, medical operations, search and\nrescue.\nIn all situations, each unit assigned must have an identified leader to supervise tasks\nbeing performed, to account for team volunteers, and to report information to his or her\ndesignated leader.\nIn all situations, a manageable span of control is five rescuers per supervisor, with an\nacceptable spread of two to seven.\nCERT personnel assigned to Operations should always be assigned to teams\nconsisting of between one and five people:\n• One person will serve as runner and communicate with the Command Post.\n• Two people will “buddy up” to respond to the immediate needs.\n• Search and rescue teams must include at least four people, with a safety team\nremaining outside the area subject to search, and at least two people to conduct\nthe search.\nImage 2.2: Expanded CERT Operations Structure\nCERT operations section structure, showing the Operations Section Chief at the top and the three\nGroup. Leaders underneath.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nDealing with the Media\nCERT volunteers should refer any media inquiries to the CERT TL. The TL should then\nrefer the media inquiries to the Public Information Officer of the CERT’s sponsoring\norganization.\nIf the Public Information Officer of the sponsoring organization refers media to the\nCERT TL or otherwise authorizes them to speak with the media, the TL should:\n• Refrain from addressing the media until doing so will no longer inhibit or delay\nthe team’s ability to do the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest\namount of time;\n• Establish an area for briefing the media if necessary;\n• Be careful about the information he or she releases, making sure it is both\naccurate and approved for release, while also keeping in mind victims’ right to\nprivacy; and\n• Not feel compelled to answer every question asked.\nNational Incident Management System Implementation\nThe ICS is part of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). NIMS provides a\nconsistent, comprehensive approach to incident management. It applies at all\njurisdictional levels and across all emergency management functions and types of\nincidents.\nNIMS was established so that first responders, including CERT volunteers, from\ndifferent jurisdictions and disciplines can work together better to respond to disasters\nand emergencies.\n• To meet NIMS standards, CERT volunteers must complete both the IS-100\n(Introduction to Incident Command System) and IS-700 (Introduction to National\nIncident Management System [NIMS]) courses.\n• Both independent study courses are available online from FEMA at\nhttp://training.fema.gov/IS/NIMS.asp.\nExercise 2.1: ICS Functions\nPurpose: This activity will give you an opportunity to relate the ICS functions to specific\nsituations.\nInstructions:\n1. Break into small table groups.\n2. This exercise provides you with the opportunity to decide under which ICS\nfunctions the listed activities will fall.\n3. Review the list of activities and use the initials, “TL,” “O,” “P,” or “L” to indicate\nwhich ICS function would cover each activity.\nWhile Finance and Administration is a part of ICS, it is generally not used by CERTs.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nUsing your knowledge about ICS functions, decide under which function the following\nCERT activities would fall. Some activities may involve more than one function to be\ncompleted (see Table 2.1).\nUse the following key to fill in the blanks before each activity:\n• Team Leader = TL;\n• Operations = O;\n• Planning = P; and\n• Logistics = L.\nTable 2.10: ICS Activities\nScenario ICS Function\n1. It’s dark, all the lights are out, and you need additional flashlights to\ncontinue your response\n2. The designated first aid site has a downed power line.\n3. A neighbor reports the smell of gas in his house, but he cannot shut\noff the gas at the meter.\n4. The batteries for the portable radio are dead.\n5. The city wants to know the overall status of your neighborhood.\n6. Several of your neighbors have minor injuries and need first aid.\n7. Fire from another neighborhood is moving toward your\nneighborhood.\n8. There is a dog seen wandering near the first aid station.\n9. A news crew has arrived with a camera to film your activities.\n10.Two hysterical neighbors are demanding help. One cannot find her\nadolescent child who was playing outside when the disaster struck.\nThe other wants help moving a bookcase off his wife. He says she’s\nbleeding from a wound on the head.\n11.It’s starting to rain. Your command post and the first aid area are not\nunder shelter\n12.Too many people are coming to the Team Leader to ask questions.\nThe Team Leader asks for someone to act as a “gatekeeper.”\n13.There is a great increase of car and foot traffic through your\nneighborhood because other roadways are blocked.\n14.The Team Leader is very tired and is going to hand over\nresponsibilities to someone else. He or she wants a report on the\nstatus of the neighborhood before doing so.\n15.Many neighborhood residents have come to volunteer their help.\n16.Reports have come in of damage and injuries in the next block.\nTeams must be assigned to assess the situation.\n17.A professional responder has arrived at the scene and would like a\nbriefing on situation status.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: CERT MOBILIZATION\nThe following steps describe how CERTs mobilize when an incident occurs:\n• If the standard operating procedure (SOP) calls for self-activation, CERT\nvolunteers proceed to the predesignated staging area with their disaster supplies.\nAlong the way, they make damage assessments that would be helpful for the\nCERT TL’s decision-making.\n• The first CERT member at the staging area becomes the initial TL for the\nresponse. As other CERT volunteers arrive, the CERT TL may pass leadership\nto someone else. The CERT TL establishes operations to ensure effective\ncommunication, to maintain span of control, maintain accountability, and help the\ngreatest number without placing CERT volunteers in harm’s way.\n• One of the CERT TL’s first decisions will be to locate the team’s Command Post.\nThe staging area may become the Command Post; however, if another location\nwould be safer or otherwise better, the Command Post should be set up there.\n• As intelligence is collected and assessed, the TL must prioritize actions and work\nwith the Section Chiefs or leaders. The CERT organization is flexible and evolves\nbased on new information.\nFollowing an incident, information—and, therefore, priorities—may be change rapidly.\nCommunication between the CERT TL and response teams ensures that CERTs do not\noverextend their resources or supplies.\nCERT On-Scene Size-up\nOn-Scene Size-up should be conducted upon CERT mobilization. Size-up is a continual\nprocess that enables professional responders to make decisions and respond\nappropriately in the areas of greatest need. CERT size-up consists of 9 steps and\nshould be used in any emergency situation.\nRefer the participants to CERT On-Scene Size-up in the Participant Manual. Although\nthe checklist is not exhaustive, it does include many of the questions that CERT\nvolunteers should ask when sizing up an emergency situation.\nCERT Size-up Steps\nThe 9 steps of CERT size-up are:\n1. Gather facts. What has happened? How many people appear to be involved?\nWhat is the current situation?\n2. Assess and communicate the damage. Try to determine what has happened,\nwhat is happening now, and how bad things can really get.\n3. Consider probabilities. What is likely to happen? What could happen through\ncascading events?\n4. Assess your own situation. Are you in immediate danger? Have you been\ntrained to handle the situation? Do you have the equipment that you need?\n5. Establish priorities. Are lives at risk? Can you help? Remember, life safety is\nthe first priority!\nAugust 2019 Page 2-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\n6. Make decisions. Base your decisions on the answers to Steps 1 through 5 and\nin accordance with the priorities that you established.\n7. Develop a plan of action. Develop a plan that will help you accomplish your\npriorities. Simple plans may be verbal, but more complex plans should always be\nwritten.\n8. Take action. Execute your plan, documenting deviations and status changes so\nthat you can report the situation accurately to first responders.\n9. Evaluate progress. At intervals, evaluate your progress in accomplishing the\nobjectives in the plan of action to determine what is working and what changes\nyou may have to make to stabilize the situation.\nTable 2.2: CERT On-Scene Size-up Worksheet\nStep 1: Gather Facts\nTime\nDoes the time of day or week affect response efforts?

Use tape around the\narea or mark the area as heavy damage. CERT volunteers do not have any legal\nauthority to stop or restrict someone who wants to enter an area. At best, CERT\nvolunteers can warn others about the danger and inform the CERT TL\nimmediately if it is known that people are in the building.\n• If the damage is moderate: Locate, assess (e.g., quickly evaluate and treat for\nairway obstruction, bleeding, and low body temperature), and immediately\nevacuate survivors to a safe area while minimizing both the number of rescuers\ninside the building and the amount of time that they remain inside.\n• If the damage is light: Locate, assess, continue size-up, and document.\nTable 2.3: CERT Rescue Efforts Based on Degree of Damage\nDegree of Damage Should Rescue be Attempted\nNo, it is too dangerous to enter. Warn people to stay away. Inform the\nHeavy\nCERT TL immediately if it is known that people are in the building.\nYes, but perform only quick and safe removals; limit onsite medical care\nModerate to checking for breathing, stopping major bleeding, and maintaining\nbody temperature. Minimize the number of rescuers inside the building.\nLight Yes, locate, assess, continue size-up, and document.\nImage 2.3: CERT Tasks Based on Damage Level\nAugust 2019 Page 2-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: DOCUMENTATION\nIt is extremely important to document and communicate information about the disaster\nsituation and resource status.\nThe efficient flow of information makes it possible for resources to be deployed\neffectively and for professional emergency services to be applied appropriately.\nDocumenting serves several purposes:\n• The CERT TL will know what is happening throughout the incident.\n• The CERT TL will have written information to pass on to the professional\nresponders when they arrive.\n• Communication improvement between functional areas and shifts.\n• The CERT will be able to show how many volunteer hours it provided to the\nsponsoring agency or entity.\n• Liability exposure will be documented.\nUnder the CERT structure, each level of organization has documentation\nresponsibilities:\n• Section Chiefs are responsible for providing the Command Post with ongoing\ninformation about damage assessment, group status, and ongoing needs.\n• The Command Post is responsible for documenting the situation status,\nincluding:\n― Incident locations;\n― Access routes;\n― Identified hazards; and\n― Support locations.\nSupport locations include:\n• A staging area;\n• A medical treatment and assessment area; and\n• A morgue, if there are fatalities.\nThis information is vital for tracking the overall situation and for the CERT TL to be\nready to provide the documentation to the first professional responders on the scene.\nWrite it down! The most important thing to do is to write down what happened.\nThe information can be written down on the sample forms provided in this unit or it can\nbe written down on sheet of paper.\nEvery entity, such as a functional team or staging location, must have a scribe to record\neverything. Typically, the CERT TL designates the scribe and provides some simple\ninstructions.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nDocumentation Flow\nHere is how a CERT would use these standard documents within the context of an\nevent. Remind participants that, even if the forms are not used, this should give them an\nidea of the preferred information that needs to be collected and communicated between\ngroups.\n• CERT volunteers complete the Damage Assessment Form as they travel through\nthe area to the CERT’s staging location. The form is then given to the CERT TL.\nThe form provides a summary of overall hazards in selected areas, and the\ninformation is used for prioritizing and formulating activities.\n• The CERT TL assembles teams and makes assignments based on the damage\nassessment information. This person keeps the CERT Assignment Tracking Log,\nwhich is the most important tool for recording the activities of the functional\nteams and overall situation status.\n• A scribe at the staging location signs in each volunteer using the Personnel\nResources Check-In Form, noting any preferred team assignments or skills. This\ninformation needs to be passed on to the Command Post.\n• The Command Post and the functional team share the Briefing Assignment\nForm. The CERT TL uses the front side of the form to communicate instructions\n(e.g., address, incident type, and team objectives) about the incident. The scribe\nof the functional team uses the blank side of the form to log team actions. The\nform is then returned to the Command Post when the team checks in.\n• The Treatment Area Record is available to document each person brought into\nthe treatment area and his or her condition.\n• The Communications Log is on-hand to log incoming and outgoing\ntransmissions; it is typically kept by the radio operator.\n• The Equipment Inventory is kept in the area or vehicle in which equipment is\nstored.\n• The General Message form is accessible for sending messages between any\ncommand levels and groups. The messages must be clear and concise.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.1: CERT Damage Assessment Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.2: CERT Personnel Resources Check-In Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.3: CERT Assignment Tracking Log\nAugust 2019 Page 2-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.4a: CERT Briefing Assignment Form\nAugust 2019e Page 2-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.4b: CERT Team Action Log\nAugust 2019 Page 2-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.5: CERT Treatment Area Record\nAugust 2019 Page 2-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.6: CERT Communications Log\nAugust 2019 Page 2-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.7: CERT Equipment Inventory Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.8: CERT General Message Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-22\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nDocumentation Forms\nThere are standard forms that can be used to facilitate documentation and information\nflow. The forms are functionally consistent with ICS forms and are designed to be NIMS\ncompliant.\nThe CERT forms are:\n• Damage Assessment;\n• Personnel Resources Check-In;\n• CERT Assignment Tracking Log;\n• Briefing Assignment;\n• Treatment Area Record;\n• Communications Log;\n• Equipment Inventory; and\n• General Message.\nRemember scribes can produce useful, high-quality documentation without using the\nforms as long as they take detailed notes of all activities.\nArea maps, site maps, and building plans are also very useful for tracking response\nactivities.\nTable 2.4: Forms Used for Response Documentation\nForm Purpose\nCompleted by CERT volunteers as they travel through the\narea to the CERT’s staging location, then given to the\nCERT Team Leader; provides a summary of overall\nhazards in selected areas, including:\n• Fires;\nDamage Assessment\n• Utility hazards;\n[CERT Form #1]\n• Structural damage;\n• Injuries and deaths;\n• Available access; and\n• Essential for prioritizing and formulating action\nplans.\nUsed to sign in CERT volunteers as they arrive at the\nstaging location; provides information about:\n• Who is on site;\nPersonnel Resources Check-In • When they arrived;\n[CERT Form #2] • When they were assigned;\n• Their special skills; and\n• Used by staging personnel to track personnel\navailability.\nUsed by the Command Post for keeping awareness of\nCERT Assignment Tracking Log\nsituation status; contains essential information for tracking\n[CERT Form #3]\nthe overall situation.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-23\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm Purpose\nUsed by the Command Post to provide instructions to\nBriefing Assignment\nfunctional teams; used by teams to log their actions and\n[CERT Form #4 a, b]\nreport new damage assessment information.\nCompleted by medical treatment area personnel to record\nTreatment Area Record\nsurvivors entering the treatment area, their condition, and\n[CERT Form #5]\ntheir status.\nCommunications Log\nCompleted by the radio operator; used to log incoming and\n[CERT Form #6 (based on ICS\noutgoing transmissions.\n309)]\nEquipment Inventory\nUsed to check out and check in CERT-managed\n[CERT Form #7(based on ICS\nequipment.\n303)]\nUsed for sending messages between command levels and\ngroups; messages should be clear and concise and should\nfocus on such key issues as:\nGeneral Message\n• Assignment completion;\n[CERT Form #8 (ICS 213)]\n• Additional resources required;\n• Special information; and\n• Status update.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-24\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nUNIT 2 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• Emergency response agencies and CERT use the ICS to manage emergency\noperations. ICS provides a flexible means of managing personnel, facilities,\nequipment, and communication and can be expanded when necessary.\n• The key question CERT Team Leaders must always ask is: “Is it safe for CERT\nvolunteers to attempt the rescue?” Whether or not to attempt a rescue depends\non the degree of damage to the structure involved. Remember: CERT volunteers’\nsafety is the top priority.\n• It is vital to document and communicate information about situation and resource\nstatus to all CERT levels.\n• Sections, Groups, and Teams must provide the Command Post with ongoing\ninformation about damage assessment, incident status, and ongoing needs.\n• The Command Post must document the situation status, so the overall disaster\nsituation can be tracked and reported to emergency response agencies.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiar with the unit that will be covered in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page

Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 3 OVERVIEW\nUnderstanding the medical operations environment in a disaster is crucial to CERT’s\nsuccess in assisting emergency responders. Units 3 and 4, Disaster Medical Operations\nPart I and II, teach life-saving steps CERT volunteers can take immediately following\ntrauma. It also provides an overview of how emergency responders apply and organize\ndisaster medical care in the event of a large-scale disaster. CERT volunteer’s\nassistance with disaster medical operations can play a vital role in limiting deaths from\ntrauma.\nUnits 3 and 4 do not provide an absolute way of how to manage disaster medical\noperations. Many localities will handle disaster medical operations differently, and there\nis not one concrete way to teach this material. Instead, the goal of Units 3 and 4 is to\nprovide a high-level overview about the immediate medical interventions CERT\nvolunteers can take to save lives, including how disaster medical operations may\noperate.\nIn a disaster, there may be more survivors than rescuers, and assistance from medical\nprofessionals may not be immediately available. While emergency medical responders\nare quick to arrive, any delay between injury and the initiation of care can result in\ndeath. Those nearest to someone with life-threatening injuries are in the best position to\nprovide the first care, which should focus on the most essential actions. These essential\nactions include moving someone away from ongoing danger, stopping life-threatening\nbleeding, positioning the injured so they can breathe, keeping them warm, and providing\ncomfort.\nCERT volunteers are trained to be part of disaster medical operations and to assist in\nproviding treatment for life-threatening conditions. Remember, the mission of CERT is\nto provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In a disaster with many\nsurvivors, time will be critical. CERT volunteers must work quickly and efficiently to help\nas many survivors as possible.\nAll CERT participants are encouraged to take basic first aid and CPR training; however,\neven if you have taken first aid courses you will need to understand CERT covers basic\nmedical interventions for life-threatening (traumatic) injuries. This course does not teach\nCPR. To find a CPR course near you, search your local chapters of the American Red\nCross and American Heart Association.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Identify life-threatening conditions resulting from trauma including severe\nbleeding, low body temperature, and airway blockage;\n2. Apply correct life saving techniques; and\n3. Provide basic first-aid care for non-life-threatening injuries.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: TREATING LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS\nWithout treatment, severe bleeding and airway obstruction can quickly lead to death.\nThe first priority of CERT volunteers assisting in disaster medical operations is to attend\nto these conditions by controlling bleeding and properly position a patient, so they can\nbreathe.\nPrior to treatment, it is critical to ensure that both the survivor and rescuer are in a safe\nenvironment to administer care. CERT volunteers should use their best judgement to\ndetermine if the situation is safe enough to help a survivor.\nSome questions CERT volunteers can consider are:\n• Do I feel safe at this spot?\n• Should I leave a move to a safer location, or am I able to stay and start providing\ncare immediately?\n• If I leave, can I take anyone with me?\nWhatever the decision is, the goal is to get help to the people who need it as soon as\npossible.\nApproaching the Patient\nWhen able, CERT volunteers should first ensure they are wearing the appropriate and\nproper personal protective equipment (PPE). For a detailed list of PPE, please\nreference Unit 1.\nThere are several steps to take when approaching a patient.\nStep 1: If the patient is conscious, be sure he or she can see you.\nStep 2: Identify yourself by giving your name and indicating the organization with which\nyou are affiliated.\nStep 3: Always request permission to treat an individual. If the individual is\nunconscious, it is assumed that the patient has given “implied consent,” and you may\ntreat him or her. Ask a parent or guardian for permission to treat a child, if possible.\nStep 4: Whenever possible, respect cultural differences.\nStep 5: Remember, all medical patients are legally entitled to confidentiality (HIPAA).\nWhen dealing with patients, always be mindful and respectful of the privacy of their\nmedical condition.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nControlling Bleeding\nThe average person has approximately five liters of blood. Severe blood loss can result\nin irreversible shock. This means that if you lose about half of your body’s blood supply,\nno matter what anyone does to try to save you, death is unavoidable. You must get\nbleeding under control as soon as possible.\nIndications of life-threatening bleeding include:\n• Spurting/steady bleeding;\n• Blood is pooling;\n• Blood is soaking through overlying clothes;\n• Blood is soaking through bandages; and\n• Amputation.\nLife-threatening decreases in blood pressure often are associated with a state of shock.\nThere are typically four stages of excessive bleeding.\nStage 1: Loss of <15% of blood volume. Patient appears normal with a slightly\nincreased heart rate.\nStage 2: Loss of 15%-30% of blood volume. Patient’s body is able to compensate for\nthe loss of blood but may appear agitated or anxious as vital signs rise.\nStage 3: Loss of 30%-40% of blood volume. Patient becomes unable to compensate\nand condition worsens. If left untreated will proceed to irreversible shock. Patient\nappears confused.\nStage 4: Loss of >40% of blood volume. Patient enters irreversible shock. Patient\nappears lethargic and death will occur within minutes because of overwhelming and\nirreversible damage to vital organs.\nTable 3.1: Stages of Severe Bleeding\nHeart Rate Blood Breath Patient\nStage Blood Loss\nPressure Rate\nLess than Normal (<100 bpm) Normal 14-20 Patient appears\nI\n15% normal\nFast (>100 bpm) Slightly Low 20-30 Patient may feel\nII 15%-40%\nanxious\nVery Fast Low 30-40 Patient feels\nIII 30%-40%\n(>120 bpm) confused\nGreater Critical (>140 bpm) Critical >35 Patient feels\nIV\nthan 40% lethargic\nTypes of bleeding are characterized by the speed of the blood flow.\nArterial bleeding: Arteries transport blood under high pressure. Blood coming from an\nartery will spurt.\nVenous bleeding: Veins transport blood under low pressure. Blood coming from a vein\nwill flow.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nCapillary bleeding: Capillaries also carry blood under low pressure. Blood coming from\ncapillaries will ooze.\nDirect Pressure\nThe first way to try to control excessive bleeding is through applying direct pressure. To\ncontrol and stop bleeding through direct pressure, follow the steps below.\nStep 1: Find the source(s) of bleeding.\nStep 2: If you have something to put in between the blood and your hands, use it. (e.g.,\ngloves, a cloth, a plastic bag.)\nStep 3: Apply firm, steady pressure directly on the source of the bleeding. Push hard to\nstop or slow bleeding—even if it is painful to the injured!\nStep 4: Keep pressure applied until EMS takes over care or bleeding has stopped. If\nyou are unsure if bleeding has stopped, continue applying pressure and wait for EMS.\nSome things to keep in mind when applying direct pressure:\n• Try to provide a barrier against the blood, if possible. Gloves are best.\n• Do not use the same gloves or barrier on more than one person.\n• If your barrier becomes blood soaked, replace it, but do not layer more things on\ntop of it.\n• Do not place bulky layers in between your hands and the source of the wound\nbecause it decreases the effectiveness of the pressure.\n• Correctly applied pressure may not be comfortable for the injured. Do not let up;\nhold pressure until EMS arrives.\nTourniquets\nIf you cannot stop the bleeding by applying direct pressure and EMS professionals are\ndelayed in responding, a tourniquet may be a viable option to save a person from\nbleeding to death. Tourniquets have been used effectively in combat to control bleeding\nin a wounded soldier’s extremities (arms or legs) and are increasingly being used by\nuniformed responders in civilian emergencies. Tourniquets are safe and effective when\napplied appropriately; you are more likely to save a life than cause the loss of a limb if\nyou use a tourniquet.\nA tourniquet is a tight bandage, which when placed around a limb and tightened, cuts\noff the blood supply to the part of the limb beyond it.\nIf a commercial tourniquet is not readily available, you can try to create one yourself\nusing something that is broad, flexible, strong, and able to be twisted, tightened, and\nsecured, such as a webbed belt or luggage strap or material. Improvised tourniquets\noften fail, but you can attempt to use them as a last resort to at least slow the bleeding.\nHow to use a tourniquet:\nStep 1: Place as high as possible on the injured limb – closest to the torso. (You can\nplace it over clothing.)\nStep 2: Pull the strap through the buckle.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nStep 3: Twist the rod tightly until bleeding stops/slows significantly. (May be very\npainful.)\nStep 4: Secure the rod.\nStep 5: If bleeding does not stop, place a second tourniquet.\nStep 6: Leave in place until EMS takes over care.\nImage 3.1: Tourniquet\nRecognizing Shock\nThe body will initially compensate for blood loss and mask the symptoms of shock;\ntherefore, shock is often difficult to diagnose. It is possible — and, in fact, common —\nfor an individual suffering from shock to be fully coherent and not complaining of pain.\nPay attention to subtle clues, as failure to recognize shock will have serious\nconsequences.\nMain signs of shock:\n• Rapid and shallow breathing;\n• Capillary refill of greater than two seconds; and\n• Failure to follow simple commands, such as “squeeze my hand.”\nWhen a patient is in shock, avoid rough or excessive handling. It is also important to\nmaintain the patient’s body temperature.\nMaintaining Body Temperature\nIf necessary, place a blanket or other material under and/or over the patient to provide\nprotection from extreme ground temperatures (hot or cold). People with very serious\ninjuries are more susceptible to hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature.\nHypothermia increases the risk of death in survivors with serious injuries, so you must\nmaintain normal body temperatures in patients as much as possible.\nTo keep a person warm, you should:\n• Remove wet clothing;\nAugust 2019 Page 3-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\n• Place something between the injured person and the ground (e.g., cardboard,\njacket, blanket, or anything that provides physical separation);\n• Wrap the injured person with dry layers (e.g., coat, blanket, or Mylar emergency\nblanket); and\n• Shield the injured person from the wind with your body or surrounding objects.\nHypothermia and other cold-related injuries will be discussed in greater detail later in\nthis unit.\nExercise 3.1: Controlling Bleeding\nPurpose: This exercise will provide a chance to practice using the techniques for\ncontrolling bleeding.\nInstructions:\n1. After breaking into pairs, identify one person to take the role of the patient and\none to take the role of the rescuer.\n2. Respond as if the patient has an injury on the right forearm, just below the elbow.\n3. Apply a pressure bandage or tourniquet (if available).\n4. Repeat the process twice.\n5. Swap roles and have the new rescuer complete the above steps.\nOpening the Airway\nPositioning an injured patient to keep their airway open and clear is critical to saving\ntheir life. The best position for the body is one in which the chest can expand fully, and\nthe airway is not at risk of being obstructed. In other words, the best position is one in\nwhich the tongue cannot flop back into the individual’s throat and one in which blood or\nfluid does not end up in the lungs (aspirated), particularly in the case with someone with\nfacial trauma.\nThe respiratory system includes the following components:\n• Lung;\n• Bronchus;\n• Larynx;\n• Pharynx;\n• Nasal Cavity; and\n• Trachea.\nThere are different ways to position an injured patient to keep their airway open\ndepending on if the patient is conscious or unconscious.\nPositioning a Conscious Patient\nSomeone who is awake will naturally assume the position that is best for them given\ntheir injuries. Despite how it looks to you, let them self-manage their airway by\npositioning their own body. Assist if needed.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nThe tripod position is a natural way to open your airway – think of catching your breath\nafter sprinting. In the tripod position, the lungs and ribcage are able to expand as fully\nas possible.\n• When sitting on a raised platform (e.g., chair, bench): Legs shoulder width\napart, elbows or hands on knees, and leaning forward slightly.\n• When standing: Legs shoulder width apart, hands on knees arms straight, and\nleaning forward with flat back.\nPositioning an Unconscious Patient\nIf an individual is unconscious, you can help by turning the person on his or her side so\ntheir chest can expand, tilting the head to drain fluid away from the airway. To assess\nan unconscious patient, consider the following diagram:\nImage 3.2: Positioning an Unconscious Patient\nRecovery Position\nIf you decide to move a patient into the recovery position, place the patient’s body like\nthis:\n• Body: Laid on its side;\n• Bottom Arm: Reached outward;\n• Top Arm: Rest hand on bicep of bottom arm;\n• Head: Rest on hand;\n• Legs: Bent slightly;\n• Chin: Raised forward; and\n• Mouth: Pointed downward.\nAlthough the risk is very small, it is possible that moving someone into the recovery\nposition could cause harm to the person’s spine. To prevent this:\n• Try to support the head and neck when rolling them onto their side.\n• Do not move them more than necessary.\nJaw-thrust Maneuver\nWhen the patient is unconscious, and you suspect there is an airway obstruction, clear\nthe airway using the jaw-thrust maneuver.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nTo perform this maneuver on an adult, kneel above the patient’s head and:\n• Put one hand on each side of the patient’s head with the thumbs near the\ncorners of the mouth pointed toward the chin, using the elbows for support.\n• Slide the fingers into position under the angles of the patient’s jawbone without\nmoving the head or neck.\n• Thrust the jaw upward without moving the head or neck to lift the jaw and open\nthe airway.\nExercise 3.2: Recovery Position\nPurpose: This exercise will provide a chance to practice using the techniques for\nmoving a patient into the recovery position.\nInstructions:\n1. Break into pairs and have one person play the rescuer and one person play the\npatient.\n2. Assume the unconscious injured individual is breathing.\n3. Place them into the recovery position using the technique you just learned.\nProviding Comfort\nCERT volunteers can be of great value to injured and emotional patients simply by\noffering comfort and support. No special skills are needed—just a calm and reassuring\npresence. Unit 5 will discuss disaster psychology in greater depth; however, it is\nimportant to note that providing comfort is a part of the immediate care CERT\nvolunteers can provide.\nA Dialogue for Providing Comfort\nShare names and ask basic questions, for example:\n• How can I help?\n• What do you need?\n• What happened?\nYou can also provide comfort to the patient by supplying information about:\n• What you currently know about what happened without speculating;\n• What is being done to assist them; and\n• What is going to happen next.\nWhat can you do?\n• Keep them warm.\n• Offer a hand to hold.\n• Maintain eye contact.\n• Be patient and understanding.\n• If you have to move on to provide aid to another person, let him or her know.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: BASIC FIRST-AID CARE\nTreating Burns\nThe first step in treating burns is to conduct a thorough size-up. A few examples of\nburn-related size-up questions to ask are:\n• What caused the burn?\n• Is the danger still present?\n• When did the burning cease?\nThe objectives of first aid treatment for burns are to:\n• Prevent hypothermia;\n• Manage pain; and\n• Reduce the risk of infection.\nHeat, chemicals, electrical current, or radiation may cause burns. The severity of a burn\ndepends on the:\n• Temperature of the burning agent;\n• Period of time the patient was exposed;\n• Area of the body that was affected;\n• Size of the area burned; and\n• Depth of the burn.\nBurn Classifications\nDepending on the severity, burns may affect all three layers of skin.\n1. The epidermis, or outer layer of skin, contains nerve endings and is penetrated\nby hairs.\n2. The dermis, or middle layer of skin, contains blood vessels, oil glands, hair\nfollicles, and sweat glands.\n3. The subcutaneous layer, or innermost layer, contains blood vessels and overlies\nthe muscles.\nTable 3.2: Burn Classification Chart\nClassification Skin Layers Affected Signs\n• Reddened, dry skin\nSuperficial • Epidermis • Pain\n• Swelling (possible)\n• Reddened, blistered skin\n• Wet appearance\n• Epidermis\nPartial Thickness\n• Pain\n• Partial destruction of dermis\n• Swelling (possible)\n• Whitened, leathery, or\nFull Thickness • Complete destruction of epidermis\ncharred (brown or black)\nand dermis\nAugust 2019 Page 3-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nClassification Skin Layers Affected Signs\n• Possible subcutaneous damage • Painful or relatively\n(destroys all layers of skin and painless\nsome or all underlying structures)\nGuidelines for Treating Heat Burns\nCool the burn:\n• Remove the patient from the burning source. Put out any flames and remove\nsmoldering clothing unless it is stuck to the skin.\n• Cool skin or clothing, if they are still hot, by immersing them in cool water for not\nmore than one minute or covering with clean compresses that have been soaked\nin cool water and wrung out. *Note that rapid temperature changes can cause\nshock in the patient, so it is important to assess the size and severity of the burn\nprior to attempting to cool the skin to prevent a drop-in body temperature.\n• Cooling sources include water from the bathroom or kitchen; garden hose; and\nsoaked towels, sheets, or other cloths.\n• Do not use ice. Ice causes vessel constriction.\nDress the burn:\n• Cover loosely with dry, sterile dressings to keep air out, reduce pain, and prevent\ninfection.\n• Wrap fingers and toes loosely and individually when treating severe burns to the\nhands and feet.\n• Loosen clothing near the affected area. Remove jewelry if necessary, taking care\nto document what you removed, when, and to whom you gave it.\n• Do not apply antiseptics, ointments, or other remedies.\n• Do not remove shreds of tissue, break blisters, or remove adhered particles of\nclothing (cut burned-in clothing around the burn.)\nGuidelines for Treating Chemical Burns\nUnlike more traditional burns, chemical burns do not result from extreme heat, and\ntherefore, treatment differs greatly (e.g., decontamination procedures). If you suspect a\nchemical burn, it is best to defer treatment to trained medical professionals.\nChemical burns are not always obvious. Consider chemical burns as a possibility if the\npatient’s skin is burning and there is no sign of a fire. If you suspect a chemical burn:\n• Protect yourself from contact with the substance. Use your protective gear,\nespecially goggles, mask, and gloves;\n• Be sure to remove any affected clothing or jewelry;\n• If the irritant is dry, gently brush away as much as possible. Always brush away\nfrom the eyes and away from the patient and yourself;\n• Use lots of cool running water to flush the chemical from the skin for at least 10\nminutes. The running water will dilute the chemical fast enough to prevent the\ninjury from getting worse;\nAugust 2019 Page 3-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\n• Apply a cool, wet compress to relieve pain; and\n• Cover the wound very loosely with a dry, sterile, or clean cloth so that the cloth\nwill not stick to the wound.\nWound Care\nThe main treatment for wounds includes:\n• Control bleeding; and\n• Apply dressing and bandage.\nTreatment for controlling bleeding was covered earlier in this unit. The focus of this\nsection is on bandaging, which will help to prevent secondary infection.\nBandaging Wounds\nOnce you have controlled bleeding, you will need to apply a dressing and bandage to\nhelp maintain the clot and prevent infection.\nThere is a difference between a dressing and a bandage:\n• Apply dressing directly to the wound. Whenever possible, a dressing should be\nsterile; and\n• A bandage holds the dressing in place.\nIf a wound is still bleeding, the bandage should place enough pressure on the wound to\nhelp control bleeding without interfering with circulation.\nRules of Dressing\nThe rules of dressing are:\n• If there is active bleeding (i.e., if the dressing is soaked with blood), redress over\nthe existing dressing and maintain pressure to control bleeding; and\n• In the absence of active bleeding, maintain the pressure and keep the wound\nbandaged until further treatment by a medical professional.\nSigns of possible infection include:\n• Swelling around the wound site;\n• Discoloration;\n• Discharge from the wound; and\n• Red striations from the wound site.\nAmputations\nIf CERT volunteers are assisting a patient with a severed body part there are a few\nguidelines to follow. Note that CERT volunteers should never amputate a body part.\nWhen the severed body part can be located, CERT volunteers should:\n• Save tissue parts, wrapped in clean material and placed in a plastic bag, if\navailable. Label them with the date, time, and patient’s name;\n• Keep the tissue parts cool, but NOT in direct contact with ice; and\n• Keep the severed body part with the patient.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nImpaled Objects\nSometimes, you may also encounter some patients who have foreign objects lodged in\ntheir bodies, usually as the result of flying debris. This situation is usually outside the\nscope of CERT training. The best course of action is to find trained medical personnel\n(EMS) to care for a patient with an impaled object. However, in the event that EMS is\nstill a long way from the scene or otherwise unavailable, there are a few steps you can\ntake to provide care.\nWhen a foreign object impales a patient, you should:\n• Immobilize the affected body part;\n• Not attempt to move or remove the object, unless it is obstructing the airway;\n• Try to control bleeding at the entrance wound without placing undue pressure on\nthe foreign object;\n• Clean and dress the wound making sure to stabilize the impaled object; and\n• Wrap bulky dressings around the object to keep it from moving.\nTreating Fractures, Dislocations, Sprains, and Strains\nThe objective when treating a suspected fracture, sprain, or strain is to immobilize the\ninjury and the joints immediately above and below the injury site. Because it is difficult to\ndistinguish among fractures, sprains, or strains, if uncertain of the type of injury, CERT\nmembers should treat the injury as a fracture.\nFractures\nA fracture is a complete break, a chip, or a crack in a bone. There are several types of\nfractures.\n• An open fracture is a broken bone with some kind of wound that allows\ncontaminants to enter into or around the fracture site.\n• A closed fracture is a broken bone with no associated wound. First aid\ntreatment for closed fractures may require only splinting.\nImage 3.3: Open and Closed Fractures\nAugust 2019 Page 3-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nIf the limb is angled, then it is a displaced fracture, which can be described by the\ndegree of displacement of the bone fragments.\nNondisplaced fractures are difficult to identify, with the main signs being pain and\nswelling. You should treat a suspected fracture as a fracture until professional treatment\nis available.\nImage 3.4: Displaced and Nondisplaced Fractures\nTreating an Open Fracture\nClosed fractures are generally treated with splinting, but open fractures are more\ndangerous because they pose a significant risk of severe bleeding and infection.\nTherefore, they are a higher priority and volunteers should check them more frequently.\nWhen treating an open fracture:\n• Do not draw the exposed bone ends back into the tissue; and\n• Do not irrigate the wound.\nYou should:\n• Cover the wound with a sterile dressing and apply pressure;\n• Splint the fracture without disturbing the wound; and\n• Place a moist 4 by 4-inch dressing over the bone end to keep it from drying out.\nDislocations\nDislocations are another common injury in emergencies. A dislocation is an injury to the\nligaments around a joint that is so severe that it permits a separation of the bone from\nits normal position in a joint.\nThe signs of a dislocation are similar to those of a closed fracture, and you should treat\na suspected dislocation like a closed fracture.\nYou should not try to relocate a suspected dislocation. You should immobilize the joint\nuntil professional medical help is available.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSprains and Strains\nA sprain involves a stretching or tearing of ligaments at a joint. Typically, stretching or\nextending the joint beyond its normal limits causes the sprain.\nA sprain is considered a partial dislocation, although the bone either remains in place or\nis able to fall back into place after the injury. Whether an injury is a strain, sprain, or\nclosed fracture, treat the injury as if it is a closed fracture.\nThe most common signs of a sprain are:\n• Tenderness at the site of the injury;\n• Swelling and/or bruising; and\n• Restricted use or loss of use.\nSplinting\nSplinting is the most common procedure for immobilizing an injury.\nCardboard is the most common type of material used for makeshift splints, but a variety\nof materials can be used, including:\n• Soft materials: Towels, blankets, or pillows, tied with bandaging materials or soft\ncloths; and\n• Rigid materials: A board, metal strip, folded magazine or newspaper, or another\nrigid item.\nVolunteers can create anatomical splints by securing a fractured bone to an adjacent\nun-fractured bone. Usually, anatomical splints are reserved for fingers and toes, but, in\nan emergency, volunteers may splint legs together.\nUse soft materials to fill the gap between the splinting material and the body part.\nWith this type of injury, there will be swelling. Remove restrictive clothing, shoes, and\njewelry when necessary to prevent these items from acting as unintended tourniquets.\nSplint Illustrations\nImage 3.5: Cardboard Splint\nTo create a cardboard splint, turn up the edges of the cardboard to form a “mold” in\nwhich the injured limb can rest.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nImage 3.5: Cardboard Splint\nTo splint using a towel, roll up the towel and wrap it around the limb, then tie it in place.\nImage 3.7: Pillow Splint\nFor a pillow splint, wrap and tie the pillow around the limb.\nImage 3.8: Anatomical Splint\nAn anatomical splint is one in which the injured leg is tied at intervals to the non-injured\nleg, using a blanket as padding between the legs.\nExercise 3.3: Splinting\nPurpose: This exercise will provide you with a chance to practice splinting techniques.\nInstructions:\n1. Break down into groups of two. One person will play the rescuer, the other\nperson will be the patient.\n2. The rescuer will place a splint on the patient’s upper arm, and then one on the\npatient’s lower leg.\n3. After several observed attempts at splinting, the rescuer and the patient will swap\nroles.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nTreating Cold-Related Injuries\nCold-related injuries include:\n• Hypothermia, which is a condition that occurs when the body’s temperature\ndrops below normal; and\n• Frostbite, which occurs when extreme cold shuts down blood flow to extremities,\ncausing tissue death.\nHypothermia\nHypothermia may be caused by exposure to cold or by trauma. The primary signs and\nsymptoms of hypothermia are:\n• A body temperature of 95º F (37º C) or lower;\n• Redness or blueness of the skin; and\n• Numbness accompanied by shivering.\nIn later stages, hypothermia will be accompanied by:\n• Slurred speech;\n• Unpredictable behavior; and\n• Listlessness.\nBecause hypothermia can set in within only a few minutes, treat patients rescued from\ncold air or water environments first by:\n• Removing wet clothing;\n• Placing something between the injured person and the ground (e.g., cardboard,\njacket, blanket, or anything that provides physical separation);\n• Wrapping the injured person with dry layers (e.g., coat, blanket, or Mylar\nemergency blanket);\n• Shielding the injured person from the wind with your body or surrounding objects;\n• Not attempting to use massage to warm affected body parts; and\n• Placing an unconscious patient in the recovery position.\nFrostbite\nA person’s blood vessels constrict in cold weather in an effort to preserve body heat. In\nextreme cold, the body will further constrict blood vessels in the extremities in an effort\nto shunt blood toward the core organs (e.g., heart, lungs, intestines). The combination\nof inadequate circulation and extreme temperatures will cause tissue in these\nextremities to freeze, and in some cases, tissue death will result. Frostbite is most\ncommon in the nose, ears, hands, and feet.\nThere are several key signs and symptoms of frostbite:\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, purple, black);\n• Burning or tingling sensation, at times not localized to the injury site; and\n• Partial or complete numbness.\nWarm a patient suffering from frostbite slowly! Thawing the frozen extremity too rapidly\ncan cause chilled blood to flow to the heart, shocking it, and potentially stopping it.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\n• Immerse injured area in warm (NOT hot) water, approximately 107.6º F.\n• DO NOT allow the body part to re-freeze, as this will exacerbate the injury.\n• DO NOT attempt to use massage to warm body parts. Frostbite results in the\nformation of ice crystals in the tissue; rubbing could potentially cause a great deal\nof damage!\nWrap affected body parts in dry, sterile dressing. Again, it is vital to complete this task\ncarefully to reduce the likelihood of further tissue damage.\nTreating Heat-Related Injuries\nAs a CERT volunteer, you may encounter several types of heat-related injuries during a\ndisaster, including the following:\n• Heat cramps: muscle spasms brought on by over-exertion in extreme heat.\n• Heat exhaustion: occurs when an individual exercises or works in extreme heat,\nresulting in loss of body fluids through heavy sweating. Blood flow to the skin\nincreases, causing blood flow to decrease to the vital organs. This results in a\nmild form of shock.\n• Heat stroke: life-threatening condition when the patient’s temperature control\nsystem shuts down, and body temperature can rise so high that brain damage\nand death may result.\nHeat Exhaustion\nThe symptoms of heat exhaustion are:\n• Cool, moist, pale, or flushed skin;\n• Heavy sweating;\n• Headache;\n• Nausea or vomiting;\n• Dizziness; and/or\n• Exhaustion.\nA patient suffering heat exhaustion will have a near normal body temperature. If left\nuntreated, heat exhaustion will develop into heat stroke.\nHeat Stroke\nSome or all of the following symptoms characterize heat stroke:\n• Hot, red skin;\n• Lack of perspiration;\n• Changes in consciousness; and/or\n• Rapid, weak pulse and rapid, shallow breathing.\nIn a heat stroke patient, body temperature can be very high — as high as 105º F. If an\nindividual suffering from heat stroke is not treated, death can result.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nTreatment\nTreatment is similar for both heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n1. Take the patient out of the heat and place in a cool environment.\n2. Cool the body slowly with cool, wet towels or sheets. If possible, put the patient in\na cool bath.\n3. Have a heat stroke patient drink water, SLOWLY, at the rate of approximately\nhalf a glass of water every 15 minutes. Consuming too much water too quickly\nwill cause nausea and vomiting in a patient of heat sickness.\n4. If the patient is experiencing vomiting, cramping, or is losing consciousness, DO\nNOT administer food or drink. Alert a medical professional as soon as possible\nand keep a close watch on the individual until professional help is available.\nInsect Bites and Stings\nIn a disaster environment, insect bites and stings may be more common than is typical\nas these creatures, like people, are under additional stress.\nThe specific symptoms vary depending on the type of creature, but generally, bites and\nstings can result in redness and itching, tingling or burning at the site of the injury, and\noften a welt on the skin at the site.\nTreatment for insect bites and stings follows the steps below.\nStep 1: Remove the stinger if still present by scraping the edge of a credit card or other\nstiff, straight-edged object across the stinger. Do not use tweezers; these may squeeze\nthe venom sac and increase the amount of venom released.\nStep 2: Wash the site thoroughly with soap and water.\nStep 3: Place ice (wrapped in a washcloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and\nthen off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process.\nAllergic Reactions to Bites and Stings\nThe greatest concern with any insect bite or sting is a severe allergic reaction, or\nanaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs when an allergic reaction becomes so severe that it\ncompromises the airway. If you suspect anaphylaxis:\n• Calm the individual;\n• If possible, find and help administer a patient’s Epi-pen. (Many severe allergy\nsufferers carry one at all times); and\n• DO NOT administer medicine aside from the Epi-pen. This includes pain\nrelievers, allergy medicine, etc.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nUNIT 3 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• CERT volunteers’ ability to provide first, live-saving measures can be critical\nduring a disaster.\n• Life-saving measures CERT volunteers can take, include:\n― Controlling severe bleeding using direct pressure and/or a tourniquet;\n― Maintaining normal body temperature; and\n― Opening airways and positioning patients correctly.\n• CERT volunteers can be of great value to injured and emotional patients simply\nby offering comfort and support. No special skills are needed — just a calm and\nreassuring presence.\n• In addition to critical life-saving measures, CERT volunteers can also administer\nbasic first aid and care to injured patients.\n• Other injuries that are common after disasters:\n― Burns;\n― Wounds;\n― Amputations and impaled objects;\n― Fractures, dislocations, sprains, and strains;\n― Cold-related injuries;\n― Heat-related injuries; and\n― Insect bites/stings.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiar with Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations — Part 2 before the\nnext session.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster\nMedical Operations – Part 2\nParticipant Manual\n2019 Update Page 3-1\n\n\n2019 Update Page 3-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2\nIn this unit you will learn about:\n\u0000 Mass Casualty Incidents: How to assist first responders in responding to mass\ncasualty incidents.\n\u0000 Functions of Disaster Medical Operations: Major functions of disaster medical\noperations.\n\u0000 Disaster Medical Treatment Areas: Types of medical treatment areas.\n\u0000 Head-to-Toe Assessment: How to perform a head-to-toe assessment to identify\nand treat injuries.\n\u0000 Public Health Considerations: How to maintain hygiene and sanitation.\n2019 Update Page 3-3\n\n\n2019 Update Page 3-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 4 Table of Contents\nSECTION 1: UNIT 4 OVERVIEW............................................................................................... 1\nUnit Objectives ....................................................................................................................... 1\nSECTION 2: MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS ........................................................................... 2\nRole of CERT Volunteers during Mass Casualty Incidents ..................................................... 2\nSECTION 3: FUNCTIONS OF DISASTER MEDICAL OPERATIONS ....................................... 4\nSECTION 4: ESTABLISHING MEDICAL TREATMENT AREAS .............................................. 5\nSafety for Rescuers and Survivors ......................................................................................... 5\nSECTION 5: CONDUCTING HEAD-TO-TOE ASSESSMENTS ................................................. 7\nObjectives of Head-to-Toe Assessments ................................................................................ 7\nWhat to Look for in Head-to-Toe Assessments ....................................................................... 7\nHow to Conduct a Head-to-Toe Assessment .......................................................................... 8\nClosed-Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries ................................................................................. 8\nStabilizing the Head ................................................................................................................ 9\nExercise 4.1: Conducting Head-to-Toe Assessments ............................................................10\nSECTION 6: PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS ...............................................................11\nMaintaining Hygiene ..............................................................................................................11\nMaintaining Sanitation ...........................................................................................................11\nWater Purification ..................................................................................................................12\nUNIT 4 SUMMARY ...................................................................................................................13\nHomework Assignment ..........................................................................................................13\nAugust 2019 Unit 4 Table of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 4 OVERVIEW\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Explain the role of the CERT volunteer during a mass casualty incident;\n2. Describe the functions of disaster medical operations;\n3. Describe how to set up survivor treatment areas;\n4. Perform head-to-toe patient assessments; and\n5. Take appropriate sanitation and hygiene measures to protect public health.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS\nMass casualty incidents are incidents in which the number of casualties overwhelms\nlocal resources. While these incidents are infrequent, CERT volunteers can play an\nimportant role by supporting local resources in responding to the incident.\nExamples of mass casualty incidents include:\n• Commuter train derailment;\n• Multi-car accident;\n• Bus accident;\n• Building collapse; and\n• Natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes).\nIn mass casualty incidents, first responder personnel:\n• Establish command and control of the incident area;\n• Conduct a scene size-up and set-up;\n• Send survivors with relatively minor injuries to a holding area to await treatment;\n• Identify survivors who require life-saving interventions and treat them\nimmediately;\n• Identify deceased victims as well as survivors too severely injured to save;\n• Manage medical transportation for survivors who require additional treatment;\n• Secure the area to protect first responders, survivors, and evidence for law\nenforcement investigations; and\n• Remove debris and other safety or health threats.\nIn addition to providing critical life-saving interventions, first responders must organize a\nlikely chaotic situation when they arrive on scene. To support first responders, CERT\nvolunteers must understand their role during mass casualty incidents.\nRole of CERT Volunteers during Mass Casualty Incidents\nWhether dispatched to the scene or located nearby by coincidence, the first task of a\nCERT volunteer is to conduct a scene size-up. Take a moment to look around the\nscene and determine the appropriate course of action.\n• Call 9-1-1 and provide the operator with the information gathered during your\ninitial size-up.\n• Put on your personal protective equipment (PPE), and any CERT affiliated gear,\nsuch as a hat, vest, or shirt.\n• Locate the nearest first responder and identify yourself as a CERT volunteer.\nGive them your local agency affiliation.\n• If a first responder is not available, assess the situation and determine whether\nyou can provide life-saving interventions, such as controlling bleeding or opening\nan airway.\n• Once responders have arrived, provide them with detailed information from your\nsize-up, and ask how you may be of assistance. Again, communicate your CERT\naffiliation to first responder personnel.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\n• For your safety, first responders may ask you to leave the area. After leaving,\nreport the incident and your role to your CERT Team Leader and/or local agency\nCERT affiliation.\n• Communication is key for supporting first responders. CERT volunteers can\nprovide valuable information to support an effective response.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: FUNCTIONS OF DISASTER MEDICAL OPERATIONS\nDisaster medical operations are the tasks associated with survivor treatment and\nsupport during a mass casualty incident. The major functions of disaster medical\noperations are:\n• Triage/Assessment: The initial assessment and sorting of survivors for\ntreatment based on the severity of their injuries;\n• Treatment: The medical services provided to survivors;\n• Transport: The movement of survivors from the scene to the treatment area or\nmedical facility;\n• Morgue: The temporary holding area for patients who died at the scene or the\ntreatment area; and\n• Supply: The hub for getting and distributing supplies.\nImage 4.11: Disaster Medical Operations Organization\nDisaster Medical Operations Organization showing the functions of disaster medical operations:\nTriage/Assessment, Transport, Treatment, Morgue, and Supply\nTriage/assessment and transport are functions of both search and rescue operations\nand medical operations.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: ESTABLISHING MEDICAL TREATMENT AREAS\nAs soon as injured survivors are confirmed, first responders will begin to set up one or\nmore treatment area(s). The location of treatment areas will take into consideration\nsafety for rescuers and survivors, as well as, ease of access to resources (e.g., medical\nsupplies, transport areas). First responders may call on CERT volunteers to help\nestablish treatment areas or supply needs.\nDecentralized Treatment Areas: It is sometimes necessary to set up more than one\nmedical treatment location. The severity of the damage, number of injuries and\ncasualties, and the safety of the immediate environment determine where the initial\ntreatment area(s) should be located. Having multiple treatment areas can provide life-\nsaving interventions when a central location is too far away from the initial treatment\narea.\n• A medical treatment location should be set up a safe distance from, but not too\nfar from, each of the damage sites.\n• Each treatment location should include physically separated treatment areas for\nsurvivors and a morgue.\n• Survivors remain under treatment at the location until first responders can\ntransport them to a location for professional medical care.\nCentralized Treatment Areas: In an event with few injured survivors at several sites,\nfirst responders may need to establish one central medical treatment location. A\ncentralized location may need to be set up even when there are decentralized sites\nestablished.\n• The location should include physically separated treatment areas and a morgue.\n• Move survivors to the treatment area from where they were initially rescued,\nassessed, and treated. They should remain under treatment there until first\nresponders can transport them to a location for professional medical treatment.\n• A central medical treatment area facilitates the effective use of resources since a\nlimited number of medical operation personnel in one location can take care of a\ngreater number of survivors.\n• First responders and other medical professionals will generally be able to\ntransport the injured more efficiently from one central location than from multiple\ndecentralized locations.\n• Move the deceased to the morgue, which should be separated from the survivor\ntreatment area, in the centralized treatment area.\nWhether a treatment area is centralized or is one in several decentralized areas, the\nlocation(s) selected should be:\n• Accessible by transportation vehicles (ambulances, trucks, helicopters, etc.); and\n• Expandable.\nSafety for Rescuers and Survivors\nCERT volunteers may play a role in light search and rescue operations. Unit 7: Light\nSearch and Rescue will cover this subject more in depth. As survivors are located,\nAugust 2019 Page 4-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nrescued, and assessed, they are moved to a location where medical personnel can treat\nthem. As a reminder, the severity of the damage, number of injuries and casualties, and\nthe safety of the immediate environment determine where the initial treatment area(s)\nshould be located. In all cases, your individual safety is the number one priority.\n• In structures with light damage, CERT members assess the survivors as they\nfind them. Further medical treatment is performed in a safe location inside the\ndesignated treatment areas.\n• In structures with moderate damage, CERT members assess the survivors as\nthey find them; however, survivors are sent to a medical treatment area a safe\ndistance from the incident.\n• CERT members are not to enter a building with heavy damage under any\ncircumstances.\nCERT volunteers should never declare or attempt to move a patient who has died. If\nyou find a deceased person (or a suspected deceased person), you should document\nthe location and notify medical personnel.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: CONDUCTING HEAD-TO-TOE ASSESSMENTS\nConducting assessments and providing rapid treatment are the first steps CERT\nvolunteers take when working with a patient.\nDuring an assessment, you should look for:\n• Severe bleeding;\n• Low body temperature; and\n• Airway obstruction.\nA head-to-toe assessment goes beyond the immediate life-threatening injuries to try to\ndetermine the nature of the patient’s injury. Perform the entire assessment before\ninitiating treatment.\nDo not conduct an assessment if a patient requires immediate care to prevent serious\ninjury or death. In these cases, CERT volunteers should administer the necessary\ntreatment before they follow up with an assessment.\nObjectives of Head-to-Toe Assessments\nThe objectives of a head-to-toe assessment are to:\n• Determine, as clearly as possible, the extent of injuries;\n• Determine what type of treatment the patient needs; and\n• Document injuries.\nRemember to wear your PPE when conducting head-to-toe assessments.\nWhat to Look for in Head-to-Toe Assessments\nThe medical community uses the acronym DCAP-BTLS to remember what to look for\nwhen conducting a rapid assessment. DCAP-BTLS stands for the following:\n• Deformities;\n• Contusions (bruising);\n• Abrasions;\n• Punctures;\n• Burns;\n• Tenderness;\n• Lacerations; and\n• Swelling.\nWhen conducting a head-to-toe assessment, CERT volunteers should look for DCAP-\nBTLS in all parts of the body.\nRemember to provide IMMEDIATE treatment for life-threatening injuries.\nPay careful attention to how people have been hurt (i.e., what caused the harm)\nbecause it provides insight to probable injuries suffered.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nHow to Conduct a Head-to-Toe Assessment\nWhenever possible, CERT volunteers should ask the person about any injuries, pain,\nbleeding, or other symptoms. If the patient is conscious, CERT members should always\nask permission to conduct the assessment. The patient has the right to refuse\ntreatment.\nBe sure to talk with the conscious patient to reduce anxiety.\nHead-to-toe assessments should be:\n• Conducted on all survivors, even those who seem all right;\n• Verbal (if the patient is able to speak); and\n• Hands-on. Do not be afraid to remove clothing to look.\nMake sure you conduct each head-to-toe assessment the same way; doing so will make\nthe procedure quicker and more accurate with each assessment. Remember to:\n• Pay careful attention;\n• Look, listen, and feel for anything unusual;\n• Suspect a spinal injury in all unconscious survivors and treat accordingly; and\n• Check your own hands for patient bleeding as you perform the head-to-toe\nassessment.\nCheck (DCAP-BTLS) body parts from the head to toe for fractured bones and soft tissue\ninjuries in the following order:\n1. Head;\n2. Neck;\n3. Shoulders;\n4. Chest;\n5. Arms;\n6. Abdomen;\n7. Pelvis; and\n8. Legs.\nWhile conducting a head-to-toe assessment, CERT volunteers should always check for:\n• Pulse, Movement, Sensation (PMS) in all extremities; and\n• Medical ID emblems on bracelet or necklace.\nClosed-Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries\nWhen conducting head-to-toe assessments, rescuers may find survivors who have or\nmay have suffered closed-head, neck, or spinal injuries.\nA closed-head injury is a concussion-type injury as opposed to a laceration, or tear\nwound, although lacerations can indicate that the survivor has suffered a closed- head\ninjury.\nThe main objective when CERT members encounter suspected injuries to the head or\nspine is to do no harm. You should minimize movement of the head and spine while\ntreating any life-threatening conditions.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nThe signs of a closed-head, neck, or spinal injury most often include:\n• Change in consciousness;\n• Inability to move one or more body parts;\n• Severe pain or pressure in head, neck, or back;\n• Tingling or numbness in extremities;\n• Difficulty breathing or seeing;\n• Heavy bleeding, bruising, or deformity of the head or spine;\n• Blood or fluid in the ears or nose;\n• Bruising behind the ear;\n• “Raccoon” eyes (bruising around eyes);\n• “Uneven” pupils;\n• Seizures; and\n• Nausea or vomiting.\nIf survivors are exhibiting any of these signs or if the survivor is found under collapsed\nbuilding material or heavy debris, you should treat them as having a closed-head, neck,\nor spinal injury.\nStabilizing the Head\nDuring a disaster, ideal equipment is rarely available. CERT members may need to be\ncreative by:\n• Looking for materials — a door, desktop, building materials — to use as a\nbackboard; and\n• Looking for items — towels, draperies, or clothing — to stabilize the head on the\nboard by tucking them snugly on either side of the head to immobilize it.\nOnly move survivors to increase the safety of the rescuer and survivor or when\nprofessional help will be delayed, and a medical treatment area is established to care\nfor multiple survivors.\n• Moving patients with suspected head, neck, or spinal injury requires sufficient\npatient stabilization. However, if the rescuer or patient is in immediate danger,\nsafety is more important than any potential spinal injury and the rescuer should\nmove the patient from the area as quickly as possible.\nUnit 7: Light Search and Rescue will cover techniques for moving survivors.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nExercise 4.1: Conducting Head-to-Toe Assessments\nPurpose: This exercise allows you to practice performing head-to-toe assessments on\neach other.\nComplete this exercise as many times as possible with different “patients.”\nInstructions:\n1. Break down into groups of two. One person will play the rescuer, the other\nperson will be the patient.\n2. The patients will lie on the floor on their backs and close their eyes.\n3. The rescuers will conduct a head-to-toe assessment on the patients, following\nthe procedure demonstrated earlier. The rescuer will then repeat the head-to-toe\nassessment.\n4. After the rescuer has made at least two observed head-to-toe assessments, the\npatient and rescuer will change roles.\n5. Each new rescuer will perform at least two head-to-toe assessments.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 6: PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS\nWhen disaster survivors are sheltered together for treatment, public health becomes a\nconcern. CERT members and CERT programs should take measures to avoid the\nspread of disease.\nThe primary public health measures include:\n• Maintaining proper hygiene;\n• Maintaining proper sanitation;\n• Purifying water (if necessary); and\n• Preventing the spread of disease.\nMaintaining Hygiene\nThe maintenance of proper personal hygiene is critical even under makeshift conditions.\nSome steps individuals should take to maintain hygiene are listed below.\n• Wash hands frequently using soap and water. Hand washing should be thorough\n(at least 15 to 20 seconds of vigorous rubbing on all surfaces of the hand).\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizers, which do not require water, are a good alternative\nto hand washing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends\nproducts that are at least 60 percent alcohol. To use an alcohol-based hand\nsanitizer, apply about ½ teaspoon of the product to the palm of your hand. Rub\nyour hands together, covering all surfaces, until hands are dry.\n• Wear non-latex exam gloves at all times. Change or disinfect gloves after\nexamining and/or treating each patient. Under field conditions, individuals can\nuse rubber gloves if sterilized between treating survivors using bleach and water\n(one-part bleach to 10 parts water).\n• Keep dressings sterile. Do not remove the wrapping from dressings until use.\nAfter opening, use the entire package of dressing, if possible.\n• Wash any areas using soap and water or diluted bleach that come in contact with\nbody fluids.\nPractice proper hygiene techniques even during exercises.\nMaintaining Sanitation\nPoor sanitation is a major cause of infection. CERT medical operations personnel can\nmaintain sanitary conditions by following some simple steps.\n• Controlling the disposal of bacterial sources (e.g., soiled exam gloves,\ndressings).\n• Putting waste products in plastic bags, tying off the bags, and marking them as\nmedical waste. Keep medical waste separate from other trash and dispose of it\nas hazardous waste.\n• Burying human waste. Select a burial site away from the operations area and\nmark the burial site for later cleanup.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nWater Purification\nPotable water supplies are often in short supply during a disaster. Purify water for\ndrinking, cooking, and medical use by heating it to a rolling boil for 1 minute or by using\nwater purification tablets or non-perfumed liquid bleach.\nThe bleach to water ratios are:\n• 8 drops of bleach per gallon of water; and\n• 16 drops per gallon if the water is cloudy or dirty.\nLet the bleach and water solution stand for 30 minutes. Note, if the solution does not\nsmell of bleach, add another six drops of bleach and let the solution stand for 15\nminutes.\nRescuers should not put anything on wounds other than purified water. The use of other\nsolutions (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) on wounds must be the decision of trained medical\npersonnel.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nUNIT 4 SUMMARY\nThe key points of this unit are:\n• During a mass casualty incident, where the number of injured and dead\noverwhelms local resources, CERT volunteers should:\n― Identify yourself as a CERT volunteer and your local agency affiliation.\n― Assess the situation and provide life-saving interventions if a first\nresponder is not available.\n― Provide responders with detailed information from your size-up when they\narrive on scene.\n― Remember that communication is key for supporting first responders.\n• Disaster medical operations include these major functions:\n― Triage/Assessment;\n― Treatment;\n― Transport;\n― Morgue; and\n― Supply.\n• Treatment areas will take into consideration safety for rescuers and survivors and\nproximity to resources.\n• Depending on the circumstances, a first responder may establish a central\nmedical treatment location and/or treatment locations at multiple incident sites\nwith many injured survivors.\n• Head-to-toe assessments should be hands-on and verbal. Always conduct head-\nto-toe assessments in the same way—beginning with the head and moving\ntoward the feet. If you suspect injuries to the head, neck, or spine, the main\nobjective is to not cause additional injury. Use in-line stabilization and a\nbackboard if you must move the survivor.\n• To safeguard public health, take measures to maintain proper hygiene and\nsanitation, and purify water, if necessary. In advance, plan all public health\nmeasures and practice during exercises.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiar with the unit to be covered in the next session.\nTry practicing a rapid head-to-toe assessment on a friend or family member.

In responding to both natural disasters and acts of violence, CERT\nvolunteers must be prepared to deal with the psychological effects of the trauma. These\nmay include fear, anger, intense sadness, frustration, and traumatic grief. Survivors and\nCERT volunteers alike are at risk for experiencing these psychological effects.\nCERT volunteers prepare themselves for their role during and following a disaster by\nlearning about the possible emotional and physical impact of disasters on them and\nothers. This knowledge helps CERT volunteers understand and manage their reactions\nto the event while enabling them to work better with others.\nRemember what you have learned about team organization. Team organization\nconcepts can help you both operationally and psychologically. Working together and\nlooking out for each other are important aspects of successful teams.\nPsychological first aid is not therapy; rather, it is a set of techniques to provide\nemotional intervention during field operations. The techniques covered in this unit will\nhelp you manage personal situations, so you can meet the needs of all survivors,\nincluding your fellow CERT volunteers.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Understand disaster trauma for survivors and rescuers, including CERT\nvolunteers.\n2. List steps to take for personal and team well-being.\n3. Demonstrate key steps to apply when providing aid to someone with survivor’s\ntrauma.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: DISASTER REACTIONS\nDuring a disaster, you may encounter things that will be extremely unpleasant. Normal\nstress reactions to disaster environments can result from:\n1. Dealing with your own personal losses;\n2. Working in your neighborhood;\n3. Assisting neighbors, friends, or coworkers who have been injured; and\n4. Feeling unsafe and insecure.\n“Vicarious trauma” is a common occupational hazard for disaster response volunteers.\nVicarious trauma—also referred to as compassion fatigue, secondary victimization, or\nsecondary traumatic stress—is a natural reaction of an individual exposed to a\nsurvivor’s trauma. A person who identifies too strongly with a survivor may take on that\nsurvivor’s feelings.\nTaking on the survivors’ feelings as your own can affect your ability to do your job as a\nrescuer and it can have long-term impact. Taking ownership of others’ problems will\ncompound your own stress and negatively affect your overall effectiveness.\nBe alert to signs of disaster trauma in yourself, as well as in disaster survivors and\nothers, such as fellow CERT volunteers, so you can take steps to alleviate stress. The\nterm “burnout” is different from trauma. Typically, individuals suffering from burnout can\novercome it by distancing themselves from their work for a period of time.\nThe Five Fs\nHumans typically have five primary responses to stress. We refer to those as the 5 Fs:\n(1) freeze, (2) flight, (3) fight, (4) fright, and (5) faint. Our bodies have both physical and\npsychological responses to stressful events. Recognizing examples of each of these\nresponses in both CERT volunteers and survivors can assist you in determining how\nbest to provide support.\n1. Freeze: “Stop, look, and listen,” or be on guard and watchful.\n2. Flight: Flee.\n3. Fight: Attempt to combat the threat.\n4. Fright: Tonic immobility when in contact with a predator or playing dead.\n5. Faint: Fear-induced fainting.\nPossible Psychological Symptoms\nYou may experience or observe others experience varied types of disaster-related\npsychological and physiological responses.\n• Emotional: nervousness; helplessness; shock; numbness; inability to feel love or\njoy; feelings of abandonment; agitation; feelings of detachment; exhilaration as a\nresult of surviving; unreal feelings; feelings of being out of control; instances of\ndenial; feelings of being overwhelmed; and feelings of fragility.\n• Cognitive: difficulty making decisions; occurrence of disturbing dreams;\nmemories and flashbacks; feelings of always being on guard or on constant alert;\nAugust 2019 Page 5-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nfeelings of dissociation; distortion of time and space; rumination or racing\nthoughts; or repeatedly replaying the traumatic event.\n• Spiritual: loss of hope; limited expectations about life, intense use of prayer; loss\nof self-efficacy; feelings of despair and disillusionment; questioning (“Why Me?”);\nredefining meaning and importance of life.\nPossible Physical Symptoms\n• Loss of appetite\n• Headaches or chest pain\n• Diarrhea, stomach pain, or nausea\n• Hyperactivity\n• Increase in alcohol or drug consumption\n• Nightmares\n• The inability to sleep\n• Fatigue or low energy\nAugust 2019 Page 5-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: SELF-CARE AND TEAM WELL-BEING\nThere is a range of actions you can take before, during, and after an incident to help\nmanage the emotional impact of disaster response work.\nKnowing in advance the possible psychological and physiological symptoms of disaster\ntrauma covered in this unit is one-step in managing the impact.\nSome other aspects of stress management for CERT volunteers include actions that\nCERT volunteers can take for themselves and actions CERT leaders can take during a\nresponse.\nWays to Reduce Your Own Stress\nOnly you know how to reduce your stress levels. It is worthwhile to spend the time and\neffort to find personal stress reducers before an incident occurs.\nYou can take the following preventive steps in your everyday life.\n• Get enough sleep.\n• Exercise regularly.\n• Eat a balanced diet.\n• Balance work, play, and rest.\n• Allow yourself to receive as well as give; you should remember that your identity\nis broader than that of a helper.\n• Connect with others.\n• Use spiritual resources.\nIn addition to preventive steps, you should explain to your loved ones and friends how\nto support you when you return from a disaster area.\n• Listen when you want to talk.\n• Do not force you to talk if you are not ready\nYou may also want to share with your loved ones and friends the information on\npossible disaster-related psychological and physiological symptoms discussed earlier.\nExercise 5.1: Self-Care Toolbox\nPurpose: This activity is to provide you with the opportunity to outline a number of self-\ncare tools that you can perform both before and during a crisis so that you are ready to\nrespond during an emergency.\nInstructions: Complete this activity individually and at your own pace. When everyone\nhas finished, you will have the opportunity to share your responses with the class if you\nwould like.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nImage 5.1: Self-Care Toolkit (Part 1)\nAugust 2019 Page 5-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nImage 5.1: Self-Care Toolkit (Part 1)\nAugust 2019 Page 5-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nHow Team Leaders Reduce Stress During the Incident\nThere are steps that CERT TLs can take to reduce the stress on rescue workers before,\nduring, and after an incident.\n• Brief CERT personnel before the effort begins on what they can expect to see\nand what they can expect in terms of emotional response in the survivors and\nthemselves.\n• Emphasize the team aspect of CERT. Sharing the workload and emotional load\ncan help defuse pent-up emotions.\n• Encourage rescuers to rest and regroup to avoid becoming overtired.\n• Direct rescuers to take breaks away from the incident area for relief from the\nstress of the effort.\n• Establish a culture of acceptance amongst the team. Encourage volunteers to\nverbalize their experiences and normalize open communication.\n• Encourage rescuers to eat properly and maintain fluid intake during the\noperation. Encourage them to drink water or other electrolyte-replacing fluids,\navoiding drinks with caffeine or refined sugar.\n• Encourage volunteers to be aware of changes in their teammates that may\nindicate personal stress and the need for a break or change of assignment.\n• Rotate teams for breaks or new duties (e.g., from high-stress to low-stress jobs).\nEncourage volunteers to talk with each other about their experiences to promote\npsychological health.\n• Do not send home volunteers who just completed a high-stress operation;\ninstead, assign them to a low-stress responsibility so they can decompress\ngradually.\n• Conduct a brief discussion with rescue workers after their shift during which they\ncan describe and express their feelings about what they encountered.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: WORKING WITH SURVIVORS’ EMOTIONAL\nRESPONSES\nCrisis survivors can go through a variety of emotional phases, and as a rescuer, you\nshould be aware of what you may encounter. The conditions associated with evacuation\nand relocation have psychological significance. When there are physical hazards or\nfamily separations during the evacuation process, survivors often experience post-\ntraumatic reactions. When the family unit is not together due to shelter requirements or\nother factors, anxiety regarding the welfare of those not present may detract from the\nattention necessary for immediate problem solving.\n• Pre-Disaster Phase: Communities will have varying degrees of warning\ndepending on the type of disaster. For example, earthquakes typically hit without\nwarning; whereas, hurricanes and floods typically strike within hours to days of a\nwarning. When there is no warning, survivors may feel more vulnerable, unsafe,\nand fearful of future unpredicted tragedies. The perception they had no control\nover protecting themselves or their loved ones can be deeply distressing.\nMeanwhile, when people do not heed warnings and suffer losses as a result,\nthey may experience guilt and self-blame. While they may have specific plans for\nhow they might protect themselves in the future, survivors often feel guilty or\nresponsible for what has occurred.\n• Impact Phase: The impact phase of a disaster varies from the slow, low threat\nbuildup associated with some types of floods to the violent, dangerous, and\ndestructive outcomes associated with tornadoes and explosions. The greater the\nscope, community destruction, and personal losses associated with the disaster,\nthe greater the psychosocial effects.\nDepending on the characteristics of the incident, people's reactions may range\nfrom constricted, stunned, shock-like responses to the less common overt\nexpressions of panic and hysteria. Typically, people respond initially with\nconfusion and disbelief and focus on the survival and physical well-being of\nthemselves and their loved ones. When families are in different geographic\nlocations during the impact of a disaster (e.g., children at school, adults at work),\nsurvivors will experience considerable anxiety until reunification.\n• Heroic Phase: In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, survival, rescuing\nothers, and promoting safety are priorities. Evacuation to shelters, motels, or\nother homes may be necessary. For some, post-impact disorientation gives way\nto adrenaline-induced rescue behavior to save lives and protect property. While\nactivity level may be high, actual productivity is often low. The capacity to assess\nrisk may be impaired, and injuries can result. Altruism is prominent among both\nsurvivors and emergency responders.\n• Honeymoon Phase: In the weeks and months following a disaster, formal\ngovernmental and volunteer assistance may be readily available. Community\nbonding occurs from the shared experience of surviving a catastrophic\nexperience and the giving and receiving of community support. Survivors may\nexperience a short-lived sense of optimism that the help they will receive will\nmake them “whole” again. When disaster behavioral health workers are visible\nAugust 2019 Page 5-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nand perceived as helpful during this phase, they are more readily accepted and\nhave a foundation from which to aid in the difficult phases ahead.\n• Disillusionment Phase: Disappointment in a slower-than-expected pace of\nrecovery can trigger this phase. Disillusionment typically occurs in the second\nhalf of the year immediately following a disaster and, again, after the disaster’s\nfirst anniversary.\n• Reconstruction Phase: The reconstruction of physical property and recovery of\nemotional well-being may continue for years following a disaster. At this point,\nsurvivors have realized they will need to solve the problems of rebuilding their\nown homes, businesses, and lives largely by themselves and have gradually\nassumed the responsibility for doing so.\nTraumatic Crisis\nA traumatic crisis is an event experienced or witnessed in which people’s ability to cope\nis overwhelmed by:\n• Actual or potential death or injury to self or others;\n• Serious injury;\n• Destruction of their homes, neighborhood, or valued possessions; and/or\n• Loss of contact with family volunteers or close friends.\nTraumatic stress may affect:\n• Cognitive Function: Those who have suffered traumatic stress may act\nirrationally, in ways out of character for them, and they may have difficulty\nmaking decisions. Additionally, they may have difficulty sharing or retrieving\nmemories.\n• Physical Health: Traumatic stress can cause physical symptoms and health\nproblems.\n• Interpersonal Relationships: Survivors of traumatic stress may undergo\ntemporary or long-term personality changes that make interpersonal relationships\ndifficult.\nMediating Factors\nThe strength and type of personal reaction to trauma vary depending on a combination\nof the following factors:\n• A person’s prior experience with the same or a similar event; the emotional effect\nof multiple events can be cumulative, leading to greater stress reactions.\n• Intensity of the disruption in the survivors’ lives; the more the survivors’ lives are\ndisrupted, the greater their psychological and physiological reactions may\nbecome.\n• The meaning of the event to the individual; the more catastrophic the victim\nperceives the event to be to him or her personally, the more intense his or her\nstress reaction will be.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\n• The emotional well-being of the individual and the resources (especially social)\nthat he or she has to cope. People who have had other recent traumas may not\ncope well with additional stresses.\n• The length of time that has elapsed between the event’s occurrence and the\npresent; the reality of the event takes time to “sink in.”\nCERT volunteers cannot know—and should never assume to know—what someone is\nthinking or feeling.\nDo not take the survivors’ surface attitudes personally. Rescuers should expect to see a\nrange of responses that will vary from person to person, but the responses they see will\nbe part of the psychological impact of the event—and probably will not relate to anything\nthat the CERTs have or have not done.\nStabilizing Survivors\nThe goal of on-scene psychological intervention on the part of CERT volunteers should\nbe to calm the incident scene by stabilizing individuals. Address any medical needs then\nuse the methods below to psychologically stabilize individuals.\n• Observe survivors to determine their level of responsiveness and decide whether\nthey pose a danger to themselves or to others.\n• Get uninjured people involved in helping. Engaging survivors in focused activity\nhelps them cope. Give them constructive jobs to do such as organizing supplies.\nThis strategy is especially effective for survivors who are being disruptive.\nProvide support by:\n• Listening: Let them talk about their feelings and their physical needs. Survivors\noften need to talk about what they have been through – and they may want\nsomeone to listen to them.\n• Empathizing: Caring responses show survivors that someone else shares their\nfeelings of pain and grief.\n• Connecting: Help survivors connect to natural support systems, such as family,\nfriends, or clergy.\nListen, Protect, Connect\nPsychological First Aid (PFA) is an evidence-informed approach to assist children,\nadolescents, adults, and families in a disaster’s aftermath. Just as you learned basic\nfirst aid in Units 3 and 4 to support the physical needs of survivors, PFA provides the\ninitial support for survivors’ psychological well-being. “Listen, Protect, Connect” is one\nmethod of PFA that can assist survivors in taking steps to bounce back more quickly.\n• Listen: The first important step to help your survivors after an event is to listen\nand pay attention to what they say (and how they say it), how they act, and what\nthey need right now. We talked previously about the many ways in which people\nmay react after experiencing a traumatic event. Remember that not all reactions\nare verbal or can be seen.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nLet the survivor(s) know you are willing to listen and talk about the event when or\nif they would like to. Understand that sometimes survivors are not ready to talk or\ndo not want to talk and that is okay. Check back with them on a regular basis to\nsee if their reactions or needs have changed.\n• Protect: This step helps survivors feel protected and allows you to protect them\nfrom added stress. This step helps survivors feel better by taking actions to\nprovide support, encouragement, and reassurance. The listening step should\nhave provided you with enough information to make informed decisions about\neach survivor’s needs.\n― Provide information or resources.\n― Answer questions simply and honestly, clearing up any confusion they\nmay have.\n― Empathize and let them know they are not alone in their reactions to the\nevent.\n― Provide opportunities for them to communicate, but do not force them.\n― Talk to them about what is being done to keep everyone safe from harm.\n― Watch for anything in the environment that could re-traumatize them such\nas sights, smells, or sounds and help them reduce contact with those\nelements.\n― Help them decide what their basic needs are and how to get access to\nthem (e.g., encouraging healthy behaviors such as food and rest).\n• Connect: Connecting survivors to their friends, loved ones, and other resources\nhas a positive impact on their recovery.\n― Assist survivors in reconnecting with friends or loved ones after a disaster.\n― Ensure you are connecting with them on a regular basis.\n― Help them find access to resources that can offer support.\nBeing an Empathetic Listener\nBeing an empathetic listener requires the listener to listen and to let the survivor talk.\nGood listeners will:\n• Put the listener in the speaker’s shoes to understand the speaker’s point of view\nmore profoundly. Draw upon experiences or try to imagine how the speaker is\nfeeling. To limit the effects of vicarious trauma, be careful not to completely take\non the speaker’s feelings.\n• Listen for meaning, not just words, and pay close attention to the speaker’s\nnonverbal communication, such as body language, facial expressions, and tone\nof voice.\n• Paraphrase the speaker periodically to make sure he or she fully understood\nwhat the speaker said and to indicate to the speaker that you are listening. This\nreinforces the communication process.\nSurvivors can show evidence of being suicidal, psychotic, or unable to care for\nthemselves. Be sure to refer these cases to EMS and/or mental health professionals for\nsupport as soon as possible.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nWhat Not to Say\nWhen providing support, you should avoid saying the following phrases. On the surface,\nyou may say these phrases to comfort the survivors, but they can be misinterpreted or\nnot well received. In general, avoid the statements below:\n• “I understand.” In most situations, we cannot understand unless we have had the\nsame experience.\n• “Don’t feel bad.” The survivor has a right to feel bad and will need time to feel\ndifferently.\n• “You’re strong” or “You’ll get through this.” Many survivors do not feel strong and\nquestion if they will recover from the loss.\n• “Don’t cry.” It is okay to cry.\n• “It’s God’s will.” With a person you do not know, giving religious meaning to an\nevent may insult or anger the person.\n• “It could be worse,” “At least you still have…”, or “Everything will be okay.” It is up\nto the individual to decide whether things could be worse or if everything will be\nokay.\nRather than provide comfort, these types of responses could elicit a strong negative\nresponse or distance the survivor from the listener.\nIt is okay to apologize if the survivor reacts negatively to something you said.\nLearn to be comfortable with silence. Do not say something just to alleviate your own\ndiscomfort.\nSay This Instead\nAlways ask permission to enter their space, provide help, or interact with them.\nAllow people to say what they need. Normalize what they are feeling and thinking using\ncommon phrases similar to those below.\n• “I’m sorry for your pain.”\n• “I’m so sorry this has happened.”\n• “Is it all right if I help you with…?”\n• “I can’t imagine what this is like for you.”\n• “What do you need?”\nManaging Death Scene\nOne unpleasant task that CERT volunteers may face is dealing with a victim who dies\nwhile under the team’s care. The guidelines below are useful for dealing with this\nsituation.\n• Cover the body; treat it with respect.\n• Follow local laws and protocols for handling the deceased.\n• Talk with local authorities to determine the plan.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nUNIT 5 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• A disaster may expose rescuers to extremely unpleasant or uncomfortable\nsituations. These experiences will be stressful and may be traumatic.\n• Over-identifying with survivors may subject rescuers to vicarious trauma.\n• Survivors and rescuers may have both psychological and physiological\nsymptoms of trauma after a disaster.\n• CERT leaders can take steps to reduce stress on rescue workers before, during,\nand after an incident.\n• CERT volunteers can take steps to reduce stress on themselves.\n• Psychological First Aid is an evidence-informed approach for assisting children,\nadolescents, adults, and families in the aftermath of disaster.\n• The steps listen, protect, and connect can provide actions associated with\nsupporting survivors after a disaster.\n• Research shows that survivors go through the following distinct emotional\nphases following a disaster:\n― Pre-Disaster\n― Impact\n― Heroic\n― Honeymoon\n― Disillusionment\n― Reconstruction\n• Traumatic stress may affect cognitive functioning, physical health, and\ninterpersonal reactions.\n• Different people react differently to traumatic stress based on a variety of\nmediating factors.\n• A traumatic crisis occurs when a person’s ability to cope is overwhelmed.\n• The goal of on-scene psychological intervention is to stabilize the incident by\nstabilizing individuals.\n• Provide support for survivors by being an empathetic listener.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiarize

Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 6 OVERVIEW\nDuring, and immediately following a fire emergency, the first priorities of fire services\nare life safety, incident stabilization, and property conservation.\nLimited access to roads, weather conditions, inadequate water supply, and limited\nresources may hamper and slow the response time of responders.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Explain the role CERTs play in fire safety and response, including the CERT\nsize-up process and minimum safety precautions.\n2. Extinguish a small fire using a fire extinguisher.\n3. Identify and reduce potential fire, utility, and hazardous materials hazards at\nhome and in the community.\nRole of CERTs\nCERTs play a very important role in fire and utility safety by supporting the following\nactions.\n• Extinguishing small fires before they become major fires.\n― This unit will provide training on how to use an extinguisher to put out\nsmall fires and how to recognize when a fire is too big to handle. As a rule,\nif you cannot put out a fire in five seconds, it is already too big to handle,\nand you should leave the premises immediately.\n• Preventing additional fires by removing fuel sources.\n― This unit will describe how to perform an “overhaul,” the process to ensure\nyou extinguish a fire completely and permanently.\n• Shutting off utilities when necessary and safe to do so.\n― This unit will review utility shutoff procedures taught in Unit 1.\n• Assisting with evacuations where necessary.\n― When a fire is beyond the ability of CERTs to extinguish or a utility\nemergency has occurred, CERT volunteers need to protect lives by\nevacuating the area and establishing a perimeter, while also notifying fire\nservices of the situation.\nCERT Priorities\nCERTs play a very important role in neighborhood and workplace fire and utility safety.\nCERT volunteers help in fire- and utility-related emergencies before professional\nresponders arrive. When responding, CERT volunteers should keep in mind the\nfollowing CERT standards:\nRescuer safety is always the number one priority. Therefore, CERT volunteers should\nalways:\n• Use the buddy system. Buddies serve an important purpose. They protect your\nsafety. Do not ever try to fight a fire alone. Stick together at all times.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\n• Wear safety equipment (gloves, helmet, goggles, N95 mask, and sturdy shoes or\nboots). Unless otherwise stated, this equipment is generally not fire-resistant\nPPE.\n• The CERT goal is to do the greatest good for the greatest number.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: FIRE CHEMISTRY\nThe Fire Triangle\nFire requires three elements to exist:\n• Heat: Heat is required to elevate the temperature of a material to its ignition\npoint.\n• Fuel: The fuel for a fire may be a solid, liquid, or gas. The type and quantity of\nthe fuel will determine which method you should use to extinguish the fire.\n• Oxygen: Most fires will burn vigorously in any atmosphere of at least 20 percent\noxygen. Without oxygen, most fuels could be heated until entirely consumed yet\nthey would not burn.\nThese three elements, called the fire triangle, create a chemical exothermic reaction,\nwhich is fire.\nImage 6.1: Fire Triangle\nClasses of Fires\nTo aid in distinguishing types of fires, fires are categorized into classes based on the\ntype of fuel that is burning.\n• Class A Fires: Ordinary combustibles, such as paper, cloth, wood, rubber, and\nmany plastics.\n• Class B Fires: Flammable liquids, including oils and gasoline as well as\ncombustible liquids such as charcoal lighter fluid and kerosene. Only the vapor\nburns when ignited.\n• Class C Fires: Energized electrical equipment, such as wires and motors. When\nthe electricity is turned off, the fire becomes a Class A fire.\n• Class D Fires: Combustible metals, including aluminum, magnesium, and\ntitanium.\n• Class K Fires: Cooking oils, such as vegetable oils, animal oils, and fats.\nIt is extremely important to identify the type of fuel feeding the fire in order to select the\ncorrect method and agent for extinguishing the fire.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: FIRE SIZE-UP CONSIDERATIONS\nAs introduced in Unit 2, size-up is a continual process that enables professional\nresponders to make decisions and respond appropriately in the areas of greatest need.\nCERT size-up consists of nine steps and should be used in any emergency, including\nduring fire situations.\nSize-up of a situation involving a fire will dictate whether to attempt fire suppression and\nwill help you plan for extinguishing the fire.\nThe safety of individual CERT volunteers is always the top priority. An effective fire size-\nup will allow participants to answer all of the following questions:\n• Do my buddy and I have the right equipment?\n• Are there other hazards?\n• Is the building structurally damaged?\n• Can my buddy and I escape?\n• Can my buddy and I fight the fire safely?\nTable 6.1: CERT Fire Size-up\nStep 1: Gather Facts\nTime\nDoes the time of day or week affect fire suppression efforts?\nYes No\nHow?\nWeather\nAre there weather conditions that affect your safety? If yes,\nYes No\nhow will your safety be affected?\nWill weather conditions affect the situation? If yes, how will the\nYes No\nsituation be affected?\nType of Construction\nWhat type(s) of structure(s) is (are) involved?\nWhat type(s) of construction is (are) involved?\nOccupancy\nAre the structures occupied? If yes, how many people are likely\nYes No\nto be affected?\nAre there special considerations (e.g. children, elderly, pets,\nYes No\npeople with access and functional needs)?\nHazards\nAre hazardous materials evident? Yes No\nAre any other types of hazards involved? Is yes, what other\nYes No\nhazards?\nAugust 2019 Page 6-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nStep 2: Assess and Communicate the Damage\nSurvey all sides of the scene. Is the danger beyond the\nYes No\nCERT’s capability?\nHave the facts and the initial damage assessment been\nYes No\ncommunicated to the appropriate person(s)?\nStep 3: Consider Possibilities\nLife Hazards\nAre there potentially life-threatening hazards? If yes, what are\nYes No\nthe hazards?\nPath of Fire\nDoes the path of the fire jeopardize other areas? If yes, what\nYes No\nother areas may be in jeopardy?\nAdditional Damage\nIs there a high potential for more disaster activity that will\nYes No\nimpact personal safety? If yes, what are the known risks?\nStep 4: Assess Your Own Situation\nWhat equipment is available to help suppress the fire?\nWhat other resources are available?\nCan CERT volunteers safely attempt to suppress the fire? If\nYes No\nnot, do not attempt suppression.\nStep 5: Establish Priorities\nAre there any other more pressing needs now? If yes, list. Yes No\nStep 6: Make Decisions\nWhere will resources do the most good while maintaining an adequate margin of\nsafety?\nStep 7: Develop Plan of Action\nDetermine how personnel and other resources should be used.\nStep 8: Take Action\nPut the plan into effect.\nStep 9: Evaluate Progress\nContinually size up the situation to identify changes in the scope of the problem,\nsafety risks, and resources availability.\nAdjust strategies as required.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSize-up is a continuous process. Evaluation of progress—Step 9—may require you to\ngo back and gather additional facts.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES\nThe most common firefighting resources are:\n• Local fire departments;\n• Fire alarm systems;\n• Sprinkler systems;\n• Portable fire extinguishers; and\n• Interior wet standpipes (water hoses found in commercial or residential buildings,\nnot for public use).\nFire Extinguishers\nPortable fire extinguishers are invaluable for putting out small fires. A well-prepared\nhome should have multiple portable fire extinguishers (locations could include kitchen,\ngarage, workshop space, and basements). Workplaces are governed by regulation or\nfire code and should have the appropriate number of fire extinguishers as defined by\nregulation or fire code.\nKeep in mind that the type of fuel that is burning will determine which resources to\nselect to fight a fire.\nTypes of Fire Extinguishers\nThere are four types of extinguishers:\n1. Water;\n2. Dry chemical;\n3. Carbon dioxide; and\n4. Specialized.\nTable 6.2: Fire Types, Extinguishing Agents, and Methods\nFire Type Extinguishing Agent Extinguishing Method\nOrdinary Solid Materials\n• Water • Removes heat\n• Foam • Removes air and heat\n• Dry chemical • Breaks chain reaction\nFlammable Liquids\n• Foam\n• Removes air\n• CO2\n• Breaks chain reaction\n• Dry chemical\nElectrical Equipment\n• CO2 • Removes air\n• Dry chemical • Breaks chain reaction\nAugust 2019 Page 6-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nFire Type Extinguishing Agent Extinguishing Method\nCombustible Metals\n• Special agents • Usually removes air\nKitchen Oils\n• Chemical • Usually removes air\nExtinguisher Rating and Labeling\nThe State Fire Marshal and Underwriters Laboratories (an organization that sets safety\nstandards for manufactured goods) rates and approves all portable fire extinguishers.\nExtinguishers are rated according to their effectiveness on the different classes of fire.\nManufacturers must label the strength and capability for each extinguisher, as well.\nThe label contains vital information about the type(s) of fire for which the extinguisher is\nappropriate. Extinguishers appropriate for Class A fires have a rating from 1A to 40A,\nwith a higher number indicating a higher volume of extinguishing agent. Extinguishers\nappropriate for Class B fires have a rating from 1B to 640B. No number accompanies\nan extinguisher rated Class C, D, or K. The C on the label indicates only that the\nextinguisher is safe to use on electrical fires. Manufacturers label extinguishers for\nClass D fires to match the type of metal that is burning and with a list detailing the\nmetals that match the unit’s extinguishing agent. The extinguishers for Class K fires\nsupplement fire suppression systems in commercial kitchens. They spray an alkaline\nmixture that, when combined with the fatty acid of the burning cooking oil or fat, creates\nsoapy foam to hold in the vapors and extinguish the fire.\nImage 6.2: Manufacturer’s Label Illustration\nSample manufacturer’s label for a fire extinguisher, showing the Underwriters Laboratories\nsymbol at the top, the type and classification of fire extinguisher, testing procedures used, and\nserial number. At the bottom of the label is marine information, including the U.S. Coast Guard\napproval number.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nWater Extinguishers\nCommon characteristics of water extinguishers include:\n• Capacity: Standard size is 2.5 gallons.\n• Range: Standard range is 30-40 feet.\n• Pressure: Standard pressure is 110 pounds per square inch (psi).\nUse extreme caution when using a water extinguisher to ensure the water, which is\nunder pressure, does not scatter lightweight materials and spread the fire.\nChemical Extinguishers\nDry chemical extinguishers are most common.\n• Dry chemical extinguishers have a sodium bicarbonate base and are effective on\nClass B and C fires.\n• Multipurpose dry chemical extinguishers have a monoammonium phosphate\nbase and are effective for Class A, B, and C fires.\nCommon characteristics of dry chemical extinguishers include:\n• Capacity: Approximately 10-20 seconds discharge time\n• Range: Standard range is 8-12 feet.\n• Pressure: Standard pressure is 175-250 psi.\nWhile still in use, carbon dioxide and other specialized extinguishers are becoming less\ncommon.\nDeciding to Use a Fire Extinguisher\nThere is a series of questions to ask before attempting to fight a fire with a fire\nextinguisher:\n• Are there two ways to exit the area quickly and safely if I attempt to extinguish\nthe fire?\n• Do I have the right type of extinguisher for the type of fire?\n• Is the extinguisher large enough for the fire?\n• Is the area free from other dangers, such as hazardous materials and falling\ndebris?\n• Am I experienced or trained in the use of a fire extinguisher?\nIf you answer “NO” to any of these questions or if you have been unable to put out the\nfire in five seconds using the extinguisher, you should:\n• Leave the building immediately (activate fire alarm system if it is safe to do so);\n• While leaving, shut all doors to slow the spread of the fire; and\n• Contact local fire department.\nIf you answer “YES” to all of these questions, you may attempt to extinguish the fire.\nEven if you answer “YES” to all of the questions but feel unable to extinguish the fire,\nyou should leave immediately. You should always remember the five-second rule.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nIf the fire is extinguished in five seconds and the area is safe, you should stay and\noverhaul the fire. Overhauling is the process of searching a fire scene for hidden fire or\nsparks in an effort to prevent the fire from rekindling. Remember “cool, soak, and\nseparate.”\nIt is always a good idea to contact your local fire department even if you were able to\nextinguish a small fire. Fire department personnel will be able to assist with properly\noverhauling and ensuring that you extinguished the fire completely. In addition,\ninsurance companies or workplace management (depending on your location) may\nwant a report to have on file regarding the incident, especially if there is any damage.\nImage 6.3: Deciding to Use a Fire Extinguisher\nImage 6.4: Components of a Portable Fire Extinguisher\nComponents of a portable fire extinguisher: hose, carrying handle\nand trigger, pressure gauge, and cylinder.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nP.A.S.S.\nThe acronym for operating a fire extinguisher is P.A.S.S.:\n• Pull (Test the extinguisher after pulling the pin.);\n• Aim;\n• Squeeze; and\n• Sweep.\nTo ensure the extinguisher is working properly, test it before approaching any fire.\nBe sure to aim at the base of the fire; it is important to extinguish the fuel, not the\nflames.\nAny fire extinguishers that have been completely depleted should be laid down and\nstored on their side so no attempt will be made to use them until they are recharged.\nImage 6.5: P.A.S.S.\nInterior Wet Standpipes\nInterior wet standpipes are usually in commercial and apartment buildings and consist\nof 100 feet of 1.5-inch jacketed hose with an adjustable spray nozzle. They deliver at\nleast 100 gallons of water per minute. Because of the size of the hose and the volume\nof water discharged, interior wet sandpipes can be difficult to manage. Therefore, CERT\nvolunteers should never operate interior wet standpipes.\nConfinement\nIn interior spaces, it is possible to confine a fire and restrict the spread of smoke and\nheat by closing interior and exterior doors.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: FIRE SUPPRESSION SAFETY\nSmall fire suppression may be one of your roles as a CERT volunteer. Your personal\nsafety must always be your number one concern. You will be unable to help anyone if\nyou have injured yourself through careless size-up or unsafe acts.\nFire Suppression Safety Rules\nVolunteers should follow all rules regarding fire suppression safety.\n• Use safety equipment at all times. Wear your helmet, goggles, dust mask, leather\ngloves, and sturdy shoes or boots. If you are not equipped to protect your\npersonal safety, leave the building.\n• Work with a buddy. Buddies serve an important purpose. They protect your\nsafety. Do not ever try to fight a fire alone. Stick together at all times.\n• Have a backup team, whenever possible. A backup team can support your fire\nsuppression efforts and can provide help if you need it.\n• Always have two ways to exit the fire area. Fires spread much faster than you\nmight think. Always have a backup escape plan in case your main escape route\nbecomes blocked.\n• Look at the door. If air is being sucked under the door or smoke is seeping out\nthe top of the door, do not touch or open the door.\n• Feel closed doors with the back of the hand, working from the bottom of the door\nup including the space between the door and its frame. Do not touch the door\nhandle before feeling the door. If the door is hot, there is fire behind it. Do not\nenter! Opening the door will feed additional oxygen to the fire.\n• Confine the fire, whenever possible, by closing doors and keeping them closed.\n• Stay low to the ground. Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of fire-related\ndeaths. Smoke will naturally rise and keeping low to the ground will provide you\nwith fresher air to breathe.\n• Maintain a safe distance. Remember the effective range of your fire extinguisher.\nDo not get closer than necessary to extinguish the fire.\n• Never turn your back on a fire when backing out.\n• Overhaul the fire to be sure that it is extinguished—and stays extinguished.\nSometimes, what CERTs should not do when suppressing fires is just as important as\nwhat they should do.\n• DO NOT get too close. Stay near the outer range of your extinguisher. If you feel\nthe heat, you are too close.\n• DO NOT try to fight a fire alone. Remember your first priority is your personal\nsafety. Do not put it at risk.\n• DO NOT try to suppress large fires. Learn the capability of your equipment, and\ndo not try to suppress a fire that is clearly too large for the equipment at hand\n(e.g., a fire that is larger than the combined ratings of available fire\nextinguishers).\n• DO NOT enter smoke-filled areas. Suppressing fires in smoke-filled areas\nrequires equipment that CERTs do not have.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nProper Fire Suppression Procedures\nRemember: CERT volunteers should use the buddy system in all cases. The job of\nTeam Member 1 is to put out a fire with an extinguisher. Meanwhile, the job of Team\nMember 2 is to watch for hazards and ensure the safety of both team members. The\nsix-step procedure for proper fire suppression is outlined below.\n1. Assume ready position. With the pin pulled, Team Member 1 holds the\nextinguisher aimed and upright, approximately 20 to 25 feet from the fire for small\nfires.\n2. When ready to approach the fire, Team Member 1 should say, “Ready.” Team\nMember 2 should repeat, “Ready.”\n3. As Team Member 1 begins to move forward, he or she should say, “Going in.”\nTeam Member 2 should repeat the command and stay within reach of Team\nMember 1.\n4. Both team members should walk toward the fire. Team Member 1 should watch\nthe fire and Team Member 2 should stay close to Team Member 1, keeping his\nor her hand on Team Member 1’s shoulder. Team Member 2’s job is to protect\nTeam Member 1.\n5. When Team Member 1 is exiting the fire area, he or she should say, “Backing\nout.” Team Member 2 should repeat the command.\n6. Team Member 2 should guide Team Member 1 from the area with his or her\nhands as Team Member 1 continues facing the fire and looking for other\nhazards. Team Member 1 must never turn his or her back on the fire scene.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 6: FIRE AND UTILITY HAZARDS\nThis section will deal with identifying and preventing fire and utility hazards in the home\nand workplace.\nEach of us has some type of fire or utility hazard in our home and workplace. Most of\nthese hazards fall into the following categories:\n• Electrical hazards;\n• Natural gas hazards; or\n• Flammable or combustible liquids.\nHomes and workplaces can and do have other hazards, including incompatible\nmaterials stored in close proximity to each other, such as flammables/combustibles,\ncorrosives, compressed gases, and explosives. Simple fire prevention measures will\nhelp reduce the likelihood of fires:\n• First, locate potential sources of ignition; then\n• Do what you can to reduce or eliminate the hazards.\nElectrical Hazards\nHere are some examples of common electrical hazards and simple ways CERT\nvolunteers can reduce or eliminate them, such as:\n• Avoid the “electrical octopus.” Eliminate tangles of electrical cords.\n• Do not overload electrical outlets.\n• Do not plug power strips into other power strips.\n• Do not run electrical cords under carpets.\n• Check for and replace broken or frayed cords\n• Maintain electrical appliances. Repair or replace malfunctioning appliances.\nResponding to Electrical Emergencies\nElectrical emergencies sometimes occur despite our best efforts. In the event of an\nelectrical emergency, first responders, and even knowledgeable members of the\nhousehold can take the following steps:\n• Locate the circuit breakers or fuses and know how to shut off the power. Post\nshutoff instructions next to the breaker box or fuse box.\n• Unscrew individual fuses or switch off smaller breakers first, then pull the main\nswitch or breaker.\n• When turning the power back on, turn on the main switch or breaker first, then\nscrew in the fuses or switch on the smaller breakers, one at a time.\nBe certain to notify a licensed electrician and/or utility company in the event of an\nelectrical emergency or fire.\nYou should not enter a flooded basement or wade into standing water to shut off the\nelectrical supply because water conducts electricity.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nImage 6.6: Circuit Box and Fuse Box\nNatural Gas Hazards\nNatural gas presents two types of hazards. It is an asphyxiant, which displaces oxygen\nin the body, and it is flammable meaning it can readily ignite under the right conditions\nIt is important to recognize that natural gas is lighter than air, and to understand that you\nwill likely not be able to feel the gas in the event of a leak. Therefore, you should place\nnatural gas detectors as you would smoke alarms, strategically on every level of your\nhome. Common places to place natural gas detectors are near the furnace, hot water\ntank, and other gas appliances such as a clothes dryer or stove. Test the detector\nmonthly to ensure it works.\nCarbon Monoxide\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly, colorless, odorless, poisonous gas that, like natural\ngas, is lighter than air. The incomplete burning of various fuels, including natural gas, is\nresponsible for producing CO. Malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces,\nranges, water heaters and room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable\ngenerators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas\nare at risk for producing CO.\nTo prevent CO poisoning, install carbon monoxide detectors, which meet the current\nsafety standards near all separate sleeping areas. You should install additional\ndetectors on every level of the home and in every bedroom. Do not place detectors\nwithin 15 feet of heating or cooking appliances or in or near very humid areas such as\nbathrooms. Test the detector monthly to ensure it works.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nNatural Gas Shutoff\nLocate and clearly label the gas shutoff valve(s). There may be multiple valves inside a\nhome in addition to the main shutoff. Know how to shut off the gas and have the proper\nnon-sparking tool for shutting off the gas. If you are unsure of how to shut off the gas\nproperly and safely, you should never attempt to do so. Contact your local gas company\nfor assistance.\nImage 6.7: Natural Gas Meter with Shutoff\nThe gas meter shutoff diagram indicates the shutoff valve location on the pipe that comes out of\nthe ground. To turn off the valve, use a non-sparking wrench to turn the valve clockwise one-\nquarter turn. Remember that, in all cases, only a licensed technician should turn on natural gas\nflow.\nPlease note: Some gas meters have automatic shutoff valves that restrict the flow of\ngas during an earthquake or other emergency. A licensed plumber installs these,\ndownstream of the utility point of delivery. If you are unsure whether your home has this\nshutoff device, contact your gas service company. If this shutoff device is closed, only a\nqualified professional should restore it.\nGas Meter Inside the Home\nIf your gas meter is located inside your home, you should only shut off the gas flow\nwhen instructed to by local authorities. If you smell gas or see the dials on your meter\nshowing gas is flowing even though your appliances are off, you should evacuate the\npremises and call 9-1-1. Do not attempt to shut off the gas from inside the building if gas\nmay be in the air.\nGas Meter Outside the Home\nYou should turn off the meter from outside the building if you smell gas or you see dials\non the meter showing gas is flowing even though appliances are off. If there is a fire you\ncannot extinguish, call 9-1-1 and turn off the gas only if it is safe to do so.\nNever enter the basement of a structure that is on fire to turn off any utility. Be sure to\nuse a flashlight, not a candle, if you need additional light to locate and shut off the gas\nvalve.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nIf you are unsure of the proper procedures, do not attempt to turn the utilities on again\nyourself, particularly in multiple-unit dwellings. Always follow your local fire department’s\nguidelines. Remember that, in all cases, after the natural gas has been shut off, only a\ntrained technician can restore it. Inappropriate or abrupt engagement of gas service\nmay cause gas leaks inside the house.\nFlammable Liquid Hazards\nTips for reducing hazards from flammable liquids:\n• Read labels to identify flammable products; and\n• Store them properly, using the L.I.E.S. method (Limit, Isolate, Eliminate,\nSeparate).\nIf you need to use a fire extinguisher, you should only extinguish a flammable liquid\nusing a portable fire extinguisher rated for Class B fires.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 7: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS\nMaterials are considered hazardous if they have any of these characteristics:\n• Corrode other materials;\n• Explode or are easily ignited;\n• React strongly with water;\n• Are unstable when exposed to heat or shock; and\n• Are otherwise toxic to humans, animals, or the environment through absorption,\ninhalation, injection, or ingestion.\nHazardous materials include, but are not limited to:\n• Explosives;\n• Flammable gases and liquids;\n• Poisons and poisonous gases;\n• Corrosives;\n• Nonflammable gases;\n• Oxidizers; and\n• Radioactive materials.\nIdentifying Hazardous Materials Locations\nThere are several ways to identify locations where hazardous materials are stored,\nused, or in transit.\n• Location and type of occupancy;\n• Placards and labels; and\n• Sights, sounds, and smells.\nLocation and Type of Occupancy\nHazardous materials are commonplace throughout every community. Many commercial\nprocesses rely on hazardous materials and many retail outlets sell them. Despite\nprotections in place, accidents and disasters can occur, causing these materials to\nrelease into the environment. Common locations in the community can include:\n• Industrial locations, such as a warehouse, rail yard, or shipyard;\n• Household locations, including under kitchen/bathroom sinks, workshop cabinets,\ngarages, basements;\n• Dry cleaner;\n• Funeral home;\n• Home supply store;\n• Big box store; and\n• Delivery van, such as overnight delivery services.\nPlacards\nWarning placards are required whenever large amounts of hazardous materials are\nbeing stored, used, or transported. These placards act as an immediate warning system\nAugust 2019 Page 6-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nfor emergency responders, helping them identify the kinds of materials present and the\ndangers they pose.\nCERT volunteers should consider these placards a “stop sign.”\nNational Fire Protection Association\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 704 Diamond is a concise system for\nidentifying the hazards associated with specific materials. CERT volunteers will find the\nNFPA 704 Diamond placard on fixed facilities where hazardous materials are used or\nstored.\nThe diamond is divided into four colored quadrants, each with a rating number inside of\nit, which indicates the degree of risk associated with the material. Numbers range from\n0 to 4. The higher the number the higher the risk!\nImage 6.8: NFPA 704 Diamond\n• The red quadrant describes the material’s flammability.\n• The blue quadrant indicates health hazard.\n• The yellow quadrant indicates reactivity.\n• The white quadrant indicates special precautions.\nThere are two symbols specified in the National Fire Codes, section 704.\n• W indicates a material that displays unusual reactivity with water (e.g., should\nnever be mixed with water or have water sprayed on it). Magnesium metal is an\nexample of a material that is reactive to water.\n• OX indicates a material that possesses oxidizing properties. Ammonium nitrate is\nan example of a material with oxidizing properties. Materials that are oxidizers\nincrease the potential for explosion or fire.\nIn addition to the above symbols that are specified under the National Fire Codes, some\nNFPA 704 Diamonds will include additional symbols:\n• ACID indicates that the material is an acid.\n• ALK indicates that the material is a base.\n• COR indicates that the material is corrosive.\n• indicates that the material is radioactive.\nThe numbers within the NFPA 704 Diamond are used to assist professional firefighters\nin responding to accidents or fires.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nThe only action CERT volunteers should take is to evacuate persons who are\ndownwind, as necessary, to an uphill or upwind location. Do not enter the building to\nevacuate people inside.\nGlobal Harmonized System\nThe Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) is\na system developed by the United Nations as a voluntary international system for\nchemical hazard communication. The GHS includes methods for classifying all\nhazardous chemical substances and mixtures.\nThere are three standard elements to a GHS safety label.\n• Symbols use pictograms to communicate physical, health, and environmental\nhazard information.\n• Signal Words indicate the severity of the hazard. “Danger” is used for severe\nhazards and “Warning” is used for less severe hazards. For lower level hazards,\na signal word is not used.\n• Hazard Statements are standardized phrases that describe each hazard\npresented by a chemical substance or mixture.\nImage 6.9: GHS Pictograms\nAugust 2019 Page 6-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nGHS labels also include the following additional elements:\n• Precautionary Statements and Pictograms provide information to minimize or\nprevent the effects from a hazard;\n• Product Identifiers, or the name or number used on a product’s safety data sheet;\n• Supplier Identification includes the name, address, and telephone number of the\nproduct’s manufacturer or supplier; and\n• Supplemental Information is additional, non-harmonized information that is not\nrequired or specified under the GHS.\nIdentifying Hazardous Materials in Transit\nThere are three ways that hazardous materials are marked and identified while in\ntransit:\n1. The Department of Transportation (DOT) placard;\n2. The United Nations (UN) system; and\n3. The North American (NA) warning placards.\nThese placards can be on any vehicle, not only tankers. Like the NFPA 704 Diamond,\nthe DOT, UN, and NA placards should be a “stop sign” for CERT volunteers. You\nshould always err on the side of safety. You should not assume that, because there is\nno placard, no hazardous materials are present. Treat any unknown situation as a\nhazardous materials incident.\n• No placard is required for less than 1,000 pounds of many hazardous materials.\n• Certain hazardous materials (e.g., anhydrous ammonia) are placarded as a\nnonflammable gas for domestic transport but as a flammable gas for international\ntransport. (Anhydrous ammonia is a flammable gas!)\n• Sometimes drivers forget to change the placard when they change their cargo.\nCERT volunteers should use extreme caution when approaching any vehicle in\nan accident.\nImage 6.10: DOT Placard Warning\nAugust 2019 Page 6-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nEmergency Response Guidebook\nFirst responders use the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) for a transportation\n(e.g., highway or railway) emergency involving hazardous materials. The guide provides\nresponders with information on how to identify the hazards quickly, and details how to\nprotect themselves and the public from issues related to the hazards. Also included in\nthe guide are the recommended evacuation distances for common hazards.\nSights, Sounds, and Smells\nHazardous materials are all around us and may be present regardless of the location or\nwhether there are placards or other posted warnings. While hazardous materials often\nsmell, sound, or look unusual, you may not be able recognize something toxic. Stay\naway from any unidentifiable substance and alert building managers or authorities.\nExercise 6.1: Suppressing Small Fires\nPurpose: This exercise will provide you with experience in two key areas of fire\nsuppression:\n1. Using a portable fire extinguisher to suppress a small fire; and\n2. Applying teamwork to fire suppression.\nInstructions: Follow the steps below to conduct this exercise.\n1. Identify possible exit routes, wind direction, and whether the fire is spreading.\n2. When ready to approach the fire, Team Member 1 should say, “Ready.” Team\nMember 2 should repeat, “Ready.” As Team Member 1 begins to move forward,\nhe or she should say, “Going in.” Team Member 2 should repeat the command\nand place his or her hand on Team Member 1’s shoulder and stay within reach of\nTeam Member 1.\n3. Both team members should walk toward the fire. Team Member 1 should watch\nthe fire and Team Member 2 should stay close to Team Member 1, keeping his\nor her hand on Team Member 1’s shoulder. Team Member 2’s job is to protect\nTeam Member 1.\n4. Team Member 1 should approach the fire from the windward side (i.e., with the\nwind to the team member’s back). When approximately 10 feet from the fire,\nTeam Member 1 should begin to discharge the extinguisher at the base of the\nfire, continuing the approach until the range for the extinguisher is optimal.\n5. Team Member 1 should sweep the base of the fire until it is extinguished.\n6. . When Team Member 1 is ready to exit the fire area, he or she should say,\n“Backing out.” Team Member 2 should repeat the command. Team Member 2\nshould guide Team Member 1 from the area with his or her hands as Team\nMember 1 continues facing the fire and looking for other hazards.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-22\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nUNIT 6 SUMMARY\nThe key points of this unit are:\n• Effective fire suppression depends on an understanding of:\n― The elements required for fire to exist;\n― The type of fuel involved;\n― The class of fire;\n― The resources required and available to extinguish each type of fire; and\n― Effective fire suppression techniques.\n• Fire requires heat, fuel, and oxygen to exist.\n• There are five types, or classes, of fire:\n― Class A: Ordinary combustibles;\n― Class B: Flammable liquids;\n― Class C: Energized electrical equipment;\n― Class D: Combustible metals; and\n― Class K: Cooking oils in commercial kitchens and cafeterias.\n• It is extremely important to identify the class of fire to use the proper extinguisher\nfor the class.\n• Portable fire extinguishers are most frequently used to suppress small fires. Their\nlabels tell the types of fires for which they are effective and the area that they can\nsuppress.\n• When using portable fire extinguishers, remember P.A.S.S.: Pull, Aim, Squeeze,\nand Sweep. Always test the extinguisher after pulling the pin.\n• When suppressing a fire, always follow the safety rules established for CERTs.\n• There are several methods of placarding hazardous materials being stored or\ntransported, including NFPA, DOT, UN, and NA placards, to help volunteers\nunderstand the types of materials found at a specific location. When faced with\naccidents involving hazardous or unknown materials, volunteers should keep\naway and call for professional help immediately.\nHomework Assignment\nBefore the next session, you

Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 7 OVERVIEW\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Identify and apply CERT size-up requirements for potential search and rescue\nsituations;\n2. Demonstrate the most common techniques for light search and rescue; and\n3. Demonstrate safe techniques for debris removal and survivor extrication during\nsearch and rescue operations.\nUnit Overview\nSearch and rescue consist of three separate operations:\n1. Size-up involves assessing the situation and determining a safe action plan\n(using the nine-step size-up model).\n2. Search involves locating survivors and documenting their location.\n3. Rescue involves the procedures and methods required to extricate the survivors.\nPrevious disasters have shown that the first response to trapped survivors immediately\nafter almost every disaster is by spontaneous, untrained, and well-intentioned persons\nwho rush to the site of a collapse in an attempt to free the survivors.\nOften, these spontaneous rescue efforts result in serious injuries and compounded\nproblems. Plan and practice rescue efforts in advance. People, including rescuers, have\ndied when the rescuers were not prepared and trained.\nDeciding to Attempt Rescue\nThe decision to attempt a rescue should be based on three factors:\n1. Risks involved to both the rescuer and the survivor;\n2. The overall goal of doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people;\nand\n3. Resources and labor available.\nGoals of Search and Rescue\nThe goals of search and rescue operations are to:\n• Rescue the greatest number of people in the shortest amount of time;\n• Get the walking wounded and ambulatory survivors out first;\n• Rescue lightly trapped survivors next; and\n• Keep the rescuers and survivors safe.\nEffective Search and Rescue\nEffective search and rescue operations hinge on:\n• Effective size-up;\n• Rescuer safety; and\nAugust 2019 Page 7-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n• Survivor safety\nThis unit focuses on the components of an effective search and rescue operation—size-\nup, search, and rescue—and the methods and techniques that rescuers can use to\nlocate and safely remove survivors.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: SAFETY DURING SEARCH AND RESCUE\nOPERATIONS\nCERT Search and Rescue Size-up\nLike all CERT operations, search and rescue requires size-up at the beginning of the\noperation and throughout its duration. As a reminder, size-up steps include:\n• Gathering facts;\n• Assessing damage;\n• Considering probabilities;\n• Assessing your situation;\n• Establishing priorities;\n• Making decisions;\n• Developing a plan of action;\n• Taking action; and\n• Evaluating progress.\nTable 7.1: CERT Search and Rescue Size-up Checklist\nStep 1: Gather Facts\nTime\nDoes the time of day or week affect search and rescue efforts?\nYes No\nHow?\nType of Construction\nWhat type(s) of structure(s) is (are) involved?\nWhat type(s) of construction is (are) involved?\nWhat type(s) of terrain is (are) involved?\nOccupancy\nAre the structures occupied? If yes, how many people are likely\nYes No\nto be affected?\nAre there special considerations (e.g. children, elderly, pets,\npeople with access and functional needs)? If yes, what are the Yes No\nspecial considerations?\nWeather\nWill weather conditions affect your safety? If yes, how will your\nYes No\nsafety be affected?\nWill weather conditions affect the search and rescue situation?\nYes No\nIf yes, how will the search and rescue situation be affected?\nAugust 2019 Page 7-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nStep 1: Gather Facts\nHazards\nAre hazardous materials involved? If yes, at what location? Yes No\nAre any other types of hazards involved? Is yes, what other\nYes No\nhazards?\nStep 2: Assess and Communicate the Damage\nFor structural searches, take a lap around the building. Is the\ndamage beyond the CERT’s capability? If yes, what special Yes No\nrequirements or specifications are required?\nHave you communicated the facts and the initial damage\nYes No\nassessment to the appropriate person(s)?\nStep 3: Consider Possibilities\nIs the situation stable? Yes No\nIs there a great risk or potential for more disaster activity that\nYes No\nwill affect personal safety? If yes, what are the known risks?\nWhat else could go wrong? Yes No\nStep 4: Assess Your Own Situation\nWhat available resources do you have to attempt the search and rescue?\nWhat equipment is available?\nStep 5: Establish Priorities\nCan CERT volunteers attempt a search and rescue safely? If\nYes No\nno, do not attempt a search and rescue.\nAre there any other more pressing needs now? If yes, list. Yes No\nStep 6: Make Decisions\nWhere will deployment of available resources do the most good while maintaining an\nadequate margin of safety?\nStep 7: Develop Plan of Action\nDetermine how best to deploy personnel and other resources.\nStep 8: Take Action\nPut the plan into effect.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nStep 9: Evaluate Progress\nContinually size up the situation to identify changes in the scope of the problem,\nsafety risks, and resources availability.\nStep 1: Gather Facts\nThe facts of the situation must guide your search and rescue efforts. When gathering\nfacts, CERT volunteers need to consider:\n• The time of the event and day of the week.\n― At night, more people will be in their homes, so the greatest need for\nsearch and rescue will be in residential settings. Conversely, during the\nday, people will be at work, so the need will be in commercial buildings.\nThe locations of people in their homes and the amount of daylight\navailable may also affect search and rescue operations.\n• Construction type and terrain.\n― Some types of construction are more susceptible to damage and the type\nof terrain will affect how best to conduct the search.\n• Occupancy.\n― The design purpose of the structure may indicate the likely number of\nsurvivors and their location.\n• Weather.\n― Severe weather will impact survivors and rescuers alike and will hamper\nrescue efforts. Consider forecasts of severe weather as a limiting factor on\nthe period during which search and rescue can occur.\n• Hazards.\n― Knowledge of other potential hazards in the general and immediate areas\nis important to search and rescue efforts. For example, if you suspect a\ngas leak, taking the time to locate and shut off the gas can have a big\nimpact in terms of loss of life.\nExercise 7.1: Gathering Facts\nPurpose: This exercise will give you the opportunity to consider some of the facts that\nCERT search and rescue teams will need to gather during size-up.\nInstructions:\n• Refer to the Scenario handout.\n• Brainstorm the following questions:\n― What does this scenario tell you about the probable density for the\naffected area?\n― What does this scenario tell you about the facts that volunteers must\ngather?\n― What impact could these facts have on search and rescue operations?\n― What kinds of search and rescue operations are probable?\n― What, if any, are the constraints that search and rescue personnel may\nface in this scenario?\nAugust 2019 Page 7-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n― Can volunteers overcome constraints within the established CERT\nmission? If so, how?\nScenario\nAt 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 9, a squall line passed through your town. Because of\nthe difference in barometric pressure on either side of the front, a “gust front” with\nstraight-line winds of more than 70 miles per hour preceded the squall line. Continued\nstrong winds and extremely heavy rain followed the gust front. The town loses\nelectricity.\nYou activate in accordance with your CERT program’s standard operating procedures\n(SOPs). On the way to the staging area at the local high school, you notice considerable\ndamage, including felled trees and utility lines. Many streets are impassable, making\nyou take a roundabout route to the high school. As you make your way to the staging\narea, you see that the roof has blown off of a large portion of a local shopping center\nand that the exterior wall on the west end of the structure has collapsed.\nAfter reaching the staging area, you check in with the Logistics Team Leader, who\nassigns you to Search and Rescue Team 2. Although CERT volunteers cannot venture\ninto the section of the shopping center that has collapsed, Search and Rescue Team 2\nwill be searching near the collapsed area to see if there are survivors in that area.\nStep 2: Assess and Communicate Damage\nThere are general guidelines for assessing damage in interior searches and exterior\nsearches. When in doubt about the condition of a building, CERT volunteers should\nalways use the more cautious assessment. If you are unsure about whether damage to\na building is moderate or heavy, CERT volunteers should assume heavy damage. The\nCERT mission changes depending on the amount of structural damage.\nCERT Mission and Types of Damages\nThe CERT mission for interior searches depends on if damage is light, moderate, or\nheavy.\nDamage is Light\nThe CERT mission is to locate; assess; treat airway, major bleeding, and low body\ntemperature; continue size-up; and document.\nLight damage includes:\n• Superficial damage;\n• Broken windows;\n• Superficial cracks or breaks in the wall surface, for example, fallen or cracked\nplaster; and\n• Minor damage to the interior contents.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nDamage is Moderate\nThe CERT mission is to locate; treat airway, major bleeding, and low body temperature;\nevacuate; warn others; continue size-up while minimizing the number of rescuers and\ntime spent inside the structure.\nModerate damage includes:\n• Visible signs of damage;\n• Decorative work damaged or fallen;\n• Many visible cracks or breaks in the wall surface;\n• Major damage to interior contents; and\n• Building still on foundation.\nDamage is Heavy\nThe CERT mission is to secure the building perimeter and warn others of the danger in\nentering the building.\nHeavy damage includes:\n• Partial or total collapse;\n• Tilting;\n• Obvious structural instability;\n• Building off foundation;\n• Heavy smoke or fire;\n• Gas leaks/hazardous materials inside; and\n• Rising or moving water.\nCERT volunteers are not to enter a building with heavy damage under any\ncircumstances.\nAssessing Damage\nAssessing the damage of a building or structure will require an examination from all\nsides. Be sure to do an initial \"lap around\" the building.\nIn assessing damage, CERT personnel must consider probable levels of damage based\non the type and age of construction.\nIn addition to a visual assessment, rescuers should also “listen” to damaged structures.\nIf a building is creaking or “groaning,” it is unstable and volunteers should not enter it.\nCommunicating Damage\nYou can describe different locations within and around the structure by using the ABCD\nstandard, with A corresponding to the front of the building and B, C, and D representing\nthe sides of the building moving clockwise from A.\nUsing this system, volunteers can break down the area inside of a structure by\nquadrants to facilitate communication. For instance, a hazard or survivor located closest\nto the A and B sides of the structure is in the A/B quadrant.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nRemember, you must communicate your findings to the CERT command post or\nresponding agencies.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nTable 7.2: Probable Severity and Type of Earthquake Damage Based on Construction Type\nConstruction\nDescription Probable Damage Areas Severity\nType\n• Wood frame • Masonry chimney Light\n• Utilities\n• Pre-1933 • Foundation Moderate\nSingle-Family movement\nDwelling • Utilities\n• Porches\n• Hillside • Unique hazards Heavy\n• Ground failure\nMulti-Family • Up-and-down and/or side- • Soft first floor Moderate\nDwelling by side living units • Utilities\nUnreinforced • Pre-1933 construction • Walls collapse, Heavy\nBrick • Lime or sand mortar then roof\n• “King Row” or\n• “Soldier Row” (bricks turned\non end every 5-7 rows)\n• Reinforcing plates\n• Arched windows and doors\n• Recessed windows and\ndoors\nTilt-up • Large warehouses and • Roof collapses, Heavy\nplants then walls\n• Concrete slabs lifted into\nplace\n• Walls in set approximately\n6-8 inches\n• Lightweight roof\nconstruction\n• Broken glass Light\n• Content movement\nHigh-Rise • Steel reinforced\n• Exterior trim and\nfascia\nStep 3: Consider Probabilities\nBecause you will be working in close proximity to the dangerous situation, considering\nwhat will probably happen and what could happen are of critical importance. Be sure to\nidentify potentially life-threatening hazards and ask:\n• How stable is the situation?\n― Even within a structure that appears from the outside to have only minimal\nor moderate damage, nonstructural damage or instability inside the\nstructure can pose real danger to the rescue team. CERT volunteers\nshould think about what they already know about the structure that has\nbeen damaged. Are lawn chemicals, paints, or other potentially hazardous\nmaterials stored within the structure? How are they stored? Where are\nAugust 2019 Page 7-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nthey? It will not take CERT volunteers much time to answer these types of\nquestions, but the answers could make a huge difference in how they\napproach the search.\n• What secondary factors should CERT volunteers consider?\n― Take a moment to look around and assess the situation outside of the\nimmediate area. What is the weather doing? Is the wind changing? Is a\nstorm moving in that would affect the response? Is there a crowd growing?\nAre there very few people around? Do you hear first responders in the\ndistance, or is everything quiet?\n• What else could go wrong?\n― Based on the information gathered during Steps 1 and 2 of the size-up,\nCERT volunteers should take a few moments to play “What if?” to try to\nidentify additional risks that they may face. What happens if the power\ngoes out during the search? What if a wall that appears stable shifts and\ncollapses? Applying “Murphy’s Law” to the situation could save CERT\nvolunteers’ lives.\n• What does it all mean for the search and rescue?\n― Based on the probabilities, CERTs should think about what they can do to\nreduce the risks associated with the probabilities that they have identified.\nIs a spotter necessary to look for movement that could indicate a possible\ncollapse and warn the rescue team? Is some remedial action required to\nstabilize nonstructural hazards before beginning the search? CERT\nsearch and rescue teams must remember that their own safety is the\npriority.\nStep 4: Assess Your Situation\nRemember that size-up is a compounding process, with each step building upon the\nprevious steps until the decision is made to either begin the search and rescue\noperation or that the situation is not safe to begin. You need to draw on everything you\nlearned from Steps 1 through 3 to assess your situation to determine:\n• Whether the situation is safe enough to continue;\n• The risks that rescuers will face if they continue; and\n• The available resources volunteers will need to conduct the operation safely.\nAssessing resources, including personnel, tools, and equipment, is extremely important\nto search and rescue operations.\nRescue Resources\nSearch and rescue resources include personnel, equipment, and tools. Below, find\nquestions that you should ask yourself regarding the availability of these types of\nresources.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nTable 7.3: Search and Rescue Resource Planning Questions\nResource Planning Questions\n• How many trained CERT volunteers are available for this\noperation?\n• Who lives and/or works in the area?\n• During what hours are these people most likely to be\navailable?\nPersonnel\n• What skills or hobbies do they have that might be useful in\nsearch and rescue operations?\n• What might be the most effective means of mobilizing their\nefforts?\n• Do all team members have everyone else’s cell number?\n• What equipment is available locally that might be useful for\nsearch and rescue?\n• Where is it located?\nEquipment\n• How can volunteers access it?\n• On which structures (or types of structures) might it be most\neffective?\n• What tools are available that might be useful to lift, move, or\nTools cut disaster debris?\n• What tools are available that will aid communication?\nStep 5: Establish Priorities\nAfter evaluating the situation and keeping in mind that the safety of the CERT volunteer\nis always the top priority, the next step is to determine:\n• What should be done; and\n• In what order.\nThe safety of CERT volunteers is always the first priority and will dictate some of the\nother priorities. For example, volunteers must complete the task of removing or\nmitigating known hazards before teams begin to search. Think through the situation\nlogically to determine how you should approach the operation.\nPriority determinations are based on:\n• The safety of CERT volunteers;\n• Life safety for survivors and others;\n• Protection of the environment; and\n• Protection of property.\nRemember your goal: Rescue the greatest number in the shortest amount of time, but\nnot at the expense of your own safety.\nStep 6: Make Decisions\nAt this point in the size-up you will make decisions about where to deploy your\nresources to do the most good while maintaining an adequate margin of safety. You will\nbase many of your decisions on the priorities established during Step 5.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nStep 7: Develop Plan of Action\nStep 7 is where all of the information you have about the situation comes together.\nDuring Step 7, the CERT Team Leader (TL) will decide specifically how the team will\nconduct its operation, considering the highest priority tasks first.\nYou do not have to write down an action plan, but when search and rescue operations\nare required, the situation is probably complex enough that a written plan of some type\nwill be important.\nA plan should:\n• Help focus the operation on established priorities and decisions.\n• Provide for documentation to give to responding agencies when they arrive on\nscene.\n• Provide for documentation that will become part of the record of the CERT’s\noverall operation.\nKeep notes as you develop your action plan. Volunteers should document any changes\nmade to the initial plan based on new information that emerges.\nStep 8: Take Action\nThis step involves putting the plan developed in Step 7 into action.\nStep 9: Evaluate Progress\nStep 9, Evaluate Progress, is the most critical step, not only in terms of evaluating\nwhether the plan works, but also from a safety standpoint.\nRemember that size-up is ongoing and that information gained during Step 9 needs to\nbe fed back into the decision-making process for possible revision of priorities and\nupdated action planning.\nSpecific Safety Considerations\nRegardless of the severity of structural damage, rescuer safety must be the primary\nconcern. The most frequent causes of rescuer deaths are disorientation and secondary\ncollapse.\nFollow these guidelines during all search and rescue operations:\n• Use a buddy system.\n― Successful search and rescue depend on teamwork.\n• Be alert for hazards (e.g., power lines, natural gas leaks, hazardous materials,\nsharp objects).\n― You should never attempt to search an area where water is rising.\n• Use safety equipment.\n― Wearing gloves and a helmet will protect a rescuer's hands and head.\nKneepads, coveralls, and thick-soled boots will protect a rescuer from\nglass and other sharp objects found on the ground following many natural\ndisasters. The primary cause of rescuer problems after working in a\nAugust 2019 Page 7-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nstructural collapse is breathing dust, so a dust mask is essential. However,\na dust mask will not filter out all harmful materials. If volunteers suspect\nthe presence of chemical or biological agents, they must evacuate to an\nupwind location and notify professional responders.\n• Have backup teams available to allow rotation of teams, prevent fatigue, and\nensure help if a team gets into trouble. Have teams drink fluids and eat to keep\nthemselves fresh.\nExercise 7.2: Search and Rescue Size-up\nPurpose: This exercise is an interactive activity that will provide an opportunity to\npractice some of the thinking processes involved in planning and search and rescue\nsize-up.\nThe brainstorming required will help you to begin to assess your neighborhoods or\nworkplaces in terms of building structures, hazardous materials, and any necessary\nsafety precautions.\nInstructions:\n1. Assemble in groups of four or five.\n2. Read the scenario given to you by the instructor.\n3. Designate a recorder and, given the disaster and the specific building, answer\nthe following questions:\n― What are the pertinent facts that must be gathered?\nWhat kind of prediction can you make regarding damage, based on the\nincident and the building construction?\n― What probable search and rescue problems can you identify?\n― What specific safety considerations can you identify?\n4. Select a spokesperson to present the group's responses to the class.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: CONDUCTING INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR SEARCH\nOPERATIONS\nWhen a CERT makes the decision to initiate search operations, CERT volunteers will\ninspect the area assigned by the CERT TL. The search operation involves two\nprocesses:\n• Employing search techniques based on the size-up; and\n• Locating survivors.\nBy using these processes, search operations will be more efficient, thorough, and safe.\nThey will also facilitate later rescue operations. Although the processes are related, this\nsection addresses them one at a time. Interior search operations are the most common\nand discussed first; exterior search operations will be discussed later in this unit.\nLocating Potential Survivors in a Structure\nThe first step in locating potential survivors in a structure is to gather more precise\ninformation about damage and to develop priorities and plans by conducting a size-up\nof the interior of the building. The data gathered will provide more information about\npossible areas of entrapment or voids.\nStructural Voids\nThere are several types of structural voids:\n• Pancake void\n• Lean-to void\n• “V” void\nSurvivors may be trapped in a structural void. If you hear any signs of life coming from a\nstructural void, report it to the TL immediately and make appropriate markings to direct\nprofessional rescuers, but do not attempt the rescue yourself. Attempting to rescue a\nperson from a structural void without proper equipment may result in completing the\ncollapse and harming the trapped person.\nIf CERT volunteers see collapsed floors or walls, they should leave the premises\nimmediately.\nIndividual Voids\nIndividual voids are spaces into which the survivor may have crawled for protection.\nExamples of individual voids include bathtubs and the space underneath desks.\nChildren may seek shelter in smaller places like cabinets.\nAfter identifying the possible areas of entrapment, CERT volunteers must:\n• Determine the potential number of survivors; and\n• Identify the most probable areas of entrapment.\nSome information may be known through assessment, but CERT volunteers may need\nto get some information by talking to bystanders or those who are familiar with the\nstructure.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nCERT volunteers should ask questions when talking with these individuals, including:\n• How many people live (or work) in the building?\n• Where would they be at this time?\n• What is the building layout?\n• What have you seen or heard?\n• Has anyone come out?\n• What are the normal exit routes from the building?\nBe aware that the event may confuse bystanders. They may tend to exaggerate\npotential numbers or may not even remember the event accurately. Gather as much\ninformation as you can, though, because it will be useful for planning search priorities\nand implementing the search.\nSearch Methodology\nAn effective search methodology:\n• Indicates rescuer location;\n• Locates survivors as quickly and safely as possible; and\n• Prevents duplication of effort.\nSearch Markings\nExperienced search and rescue personnel use the following system. CERTs will use the\nsame system. This will save time for fellow CERT volunteers and other responders\nduring the search and continual size-up of the structure.\nUpon entering a search area, you will make a mark next to the door to indicate that you\nare entering. Do not make the mark on the door or on the wall where the door swings.\nMake a single slash and write the agency or group ID at the “9 o’clock” position. Then\nwrite the date and “time in” at the “12 o’clock” position.\nUpon exiting the search area, make another slash to form an “X” (the agency or group\nID will be in the left quadrant). Enter the search “time out” In the top quadrant.\n• Right quadrant: Enter the areas of the structure searched and any specific\ninformation about hazards.\n• Lower quadrant: Enter information about the survivors found in the search area.\n“L” represents living and “D” represents dead. The search marking on the front of\na structure or building should contain the total number of survivors, whereas\nsearch markings inside the structure or building will include survivor totals for\nspecific search areas. Indicate where survivors were taken.\nSearch Methodology\n• Use the buddy system.\n― Always remain within arm’s reach of at least one other CERT volunteer\nwhen conducting an interior search. This is to enable assistance in the\nevent of a slip or a fall and to be able to push or pull one another out of\nharm's way.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n• Upon entering each space or room, call out to survivors.\n― Shout something like, \"If anyone can hear my voice, come here.\" If any\nsurvivors come to you, ask them for any information that they may have\nabout the building or others who may be trapped then, depending on the\ncondition of the building, give them further directions such as, \"Stay here\"\nor \"Wait outside\".\nRemember that even those who are able to get to you may be in shock and confused.\nWhen giving directions to survivors, CERT volunteers should look directly at the\nsurvivors, speak in short sentences, and keep their directions simple.\nUse a systematic search pattern. Ensure that all areas of the building are covered.\nExamples of systematic search patterns to use include:\n• Bottom-up/top-down; and\n• Right wall/left wall.\nKeep in mind that every interior space has six sides — including the floor and ceiling.\nRescuers must check all six sides to locate hazards such as fixtures that may be\nhanging from the ceiling\n• Stop frequently to listen: Listen for tapping, movement, or voices.\n• Triangulate: Consider using triangulation when a potential survivor’s location is\nobscured. If access permits, three rescuers, guided by survivor sounds, form a\ntriangle around the area and direct flashlights into the area. The light shining from\ndifferent directions will eliminate shadows that could otherwise hide survivors.\nTriangulation should not be used as an initial search method.\n• Report results: Keep complete records both of removed survivors and of\nsurvivors who remain trapped or are dead. Report this information to emergency\nservices personnel when they reach the scene.\nExterior Search\nIn addition to searching inside a structure, CERT volunteers may need to search open\nareas outside of buildings.\nConducting an effective search in open areas requires that searchers work methodically\nand follow standard procedures established by those in charge of the search operation.\nThis is true in all cases, especially if the area is a crime scene, where all potential\nevidence must be protected.\nIf searchers are needed, they should assemble in a central staging area and sign in.\nAuthorities will brief the searchers on what they will be looking for, what areas they are\nresponsible for searching, the pattern of the search, and what they should do if they\ndiscover the missing person, evidence, or related information.\nExterior search patterns include grid, line, quadrant or zone, and spiral. Typically, a grid\npattern is used in large open areas or small areas when a hands-and-knees search is\nconducted.\nGrid is one of the most commonly used types of search patterns. Keep the guidelines\nbelow in mind when conducting a grid search.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n• View the search area as a grid, with searchers initially positioned at one side of\nthe grid.\n• The distance between the searchers should be set according to visibility and\ndebris. In all cases, searchers must remain within line of sight and voice contact\nwith searchers on either side of them.\n• It is critical that the area assigned to each searcher overlaps that of the\nsearchers on either side of them.\n• The searchers proceed, maintaining as straight a line as possible across the\nentire search area. As each searcher moves across the area, they conduct a\nthorough search for survivors within their designated row of the grid.\n• To ensure full coverage, CERTs must record each area searched.\n• A grid search might be particularly useful following a tornado or hurricane.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: CONDUCTING RESCUE OPERATIONS\nRescues involve three primary functions:\n1. Moving objects and debris to create a safe rescue environment and free\nsurvivors;\n2. Assessing survivors, checking for life-threatening conditions such as airway\nobstruction, severe bleeding, and low body temperature; and\n3. Removing survivors as safely and as quickly as possible.\nCreating a Safe Environment\nThere are three safety considerations for all rescue operations:\n1. Maintain rescuer safety;\n2. Assess survivors in lightly and moderately damaged buildings; and\n3. Evacuate survivors as quickly as possible from moderately damaged buildings\nwhile minimizing additional injury.\nCERTs cannot achieve these considerations without creating as safe an environment as\npossible before attempting rescue. Therefore, there are certain precautions that\nrescuers must take to minimize risk.\nPrecautions to Minimize Risk\nThere are certain precautions that rescuers must take to minimize risk and increase\ntheir chances of achieving their rescue goals.\n• Know Your Limitations: Many volunteers have been injured or killed during\nrescue operations because they did not pay attention to their own physical and\nmental limitations. CERT rescuers should take the time to drink fluids, eat, relax,\nand rest so that they can return with a clear mind and improved energy.\n• Follow Safety Procedures: CERT volunteers should always use the proper\nsafety equipment required for the situation and follow established procedures,\nincluding:\n― Work in pairs.\n― Assess and treat only in lightly damaged buildings.\n― In moderately damaged buildings, assess only and remove survivors as\nquickly as possible.\n― Never enter an unstable structure.\n― Lift by bending the knees, keeping the back straight, and pushing up with\nthe legs.\n― Carry the load close to the body.\n― Lift and carry no more than is reasonable.\n• Remove Debris: Remove debris as needed to minimize risk to rescuers and to\nfree entrapped survivors.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.1: Proper Body Position for Lifting\nProper body position for lifting showing the back straight and lifting with the knees.\nLeveraging and Cribbing\nYou may encounter situations in which moving debris is needed to free survivors. In\nthese situations, CERT rescuers should consider leveraging and cribbing to move and\nstabilize the debris until the rescue is complete.\n• Leveraging is accomplished by wedging a lever under the object that needs to be\nmoved, with a stationary object underneath it to act as a fulcrum. When the lever\nis forced down over the fulcrum, the far end of the lever will lift the object.\n• A crib is a wooden framework used for support or strengthening the object.\n― Box cribbing means arranging pairs of wood pieces alternately to form a\nstable rectangle.\n― You may use a variety of cribbing materials for these procedures and you\nwill need to improvise by using materials such as tires or structural debris.\nWhatever you use, do not put form over function.\nVolunteers may use leveraging and cribbing together by alternately lifting the object and\nplacing cribbing materials underneath the lifted edge to stabilize it.\nSafety is number one: \"Lift an inch; crib an inch.\" Leveraging and cribbing should be\ngradual for stability, safety, and efficiency.\nIt may also be necessary to use leveraging and cribbing at more than one location (e.g.,\nfront and back) to ensure stability. Never leverage and crib on opposite ends at the\nsame time because doing so will increase the instability of the debris. If leveraging is\nrequired at both ends, lift and crib at one end, then repeat the process at the other end.\nPositioning the lever and the fulcrum correctly is critical for safe operations. The fulcrum\nand pry tool must be perpendicular (90 degrees) to the edge of the object being lifted.\nAttempting to leverage a heavy object using too sharp an angle is inefficient and can\nresult in back injury.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nBox cribbing is stable, but it requires pieces of cribbing material of relatively uniform\nsize. When such material is not available, “unboxed” cribbing can also work effectively\nto support and stabilize the heavy object.\nWhen you are able to achieve sufficient lift, you should remove the survivor and reverse\nthe leveraging and cribbing procedure to lower the object. You should never leave an\nunsafe condition unless the event has left the structure or building obviously\ncompromised.\nWhen you must remove debris to locate survivors, you should set up a human chain\nand pass the debris from one person to the next. Be careful, however, to set up the\nchain in a position that will not interfere with rescue operations.\nWear your PPE to protect yourself always. Kneepads can be an important addition to\nyour PPE during rescue operations.\nLeveraging and Cribbing Steps\nStep 1: Conduct a size-up of the scene. Gather facts, identify hazards, and establish\npriorities.\nStep 2: Have one person in charge and formulate a plan of action, based upon the\ninformation you have received, to identify how and where to lift and crib and to\ndetermine how you will remove the survivor from underneath the debris.\nStep 3: Gather necessary materials for lifting/cribbing operations: lever, fulcrum,\ncribbing blocks, spacers/wedges. During an actual emergency, you may have to use\ncreative, substitute materials.\nStep 4: Use cribbing materials to stabilize the object prior to lifting.\nStep 5: Distribute cribbing materials as necessary to be readily accessible during the\nlifting operation.\nStep 6: Prepare to lift the object: Assemble the lever and fulcrum at the previously\nidentified location.\nStep 7: Assign a person to monitor and be ready to remove the survivor as soon as\npossible.\nStep 8: Initiate the lift, using the lever and fulcrum for mechanical advantage.\nStep 9: As the object is lifted, add cribbing as needed, one layer at a time.\nStep 10: Once the object is adequately supported, remove the lever and fulcrum. You\nmay then remove the survivor.\nStep 11: Unless the event has left the structure obviously compromised, requiring you\nto evacuate immediately, reinitiate the lift and begin removing cribbing materials,\nreversing the process by which you built the crib.\nStep 12: Progressively lower the object to the ground. Always return the heavy object to\na stable position unless you have to evacuate immediately.\nStep 13: Before you leave, remember to collect the lifting/cribbing supplies to be\navailable for additional operations.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.2: Leveraging and Cribbing\nTeam Organization for Leveraging/Cribbing Operations\nTeam organization for leveraging/cribbing operation, showing the survivor underneath a\ncollapsed wall and the CERT volunteers at the following locations:\n• Group Leader: In front of collapse, positioned so that he or she can view the\nentire operation while remaining out of the rescuers’ way;\n• Lever Person: At the front edge of the collapsed wall and positioned so that he\nor she can position a fulcrum and lever under the wall;\n• Crib Persons: On either side of the collapsed wall and positioned to enable the\nplacement of cribbing as the wall is raised with the lever; and\n• Medical Care/Survivor Removal Person: Next to the Crib Person who is\nclosest to the survivor’s head.\nImage 7.3: Box Cribbing\nAugust 2019 Page 7-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nSteps for building box cribbing:\nStep 1: Position two pieces of wood parallel to each other on either side of the collapse.\nStep 2: Place two pieces of wood perpendicularly across the base pieces.\nSteps 3 and 4: Add additional layers of wood, with each perpendicular to the previous\nlevel.\nRemoving Survivors\nThe basic types of survivor removal are:\n• Self-removal or assist; and\n• Lifts and drags.\nIt is usually best to allow an ambulatory survivor to extricate him or herself. Be aware\nthat ambulatory survivors are not always as strong and free of injury as they believe.\nWhen survivors are freed, they may need assistance to exit the structure.\nExtrication Method\nThe type of extrication method selected should depend on the:\n• General stability of the immediate environment;\n• Number of rescuers available;\n• Strength and ability of the rescuers; and\n• Condition of the survivor.\nIf safety and time permit, you should not use lifts and drags to remove survivors when\nyou suspect the survivors have closed-head or spinal injuries. In such cases, stabilize\nthe spine using a backboard. You can use doors, tables, and similar materials as\nimprovised backboards. The backboard must be able to carry the person and remember\nto use proper lifting techniques.\nWhen moving survivors, rescuers must use teamwork and communication and try to\nkeep the survivor's spine in a straight line. Remember, rescuer safety and the condition\nof the building will dictate the approach.\nOne-Person Arm Carry\nIf a rescuer is physically able and the survivor is small, the rescuer may use the one-\nperson arm carry to lift and carry the survivor by:\n• Reaching around the survivor’s back and under the knees; and\n• Lifting the survivor while keeping your back straight and lifting with your legs.\nConsider the size of the survivor and the distance in which you will need to carry\nhim or her before using this carry.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-22\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.4: One-Person Arm Carry\nOne-Person Arm Carry with rescuer holding survivor around the back and under the knees.\nPack-Strap Carry\nAnother way for a single rescuer to lift a survivor safely is by using the one-person pack-\nstrap carry. Using this method, you should:\nStep 1: Stand with your back to the survivor.\nStep 2: Place the survivor's arms over your shoulders and grab the hands in front of\nyour chest.\nStep 3: Hoist the survivor by bending forward slightly, until the survivor’s feet just clear\nthe floor.\n*Note: The pack-strap carry is most effective for quick removal of a survivor over a\nshort distance.\nImage 7.5: Pack-Strap Carry\nOne-Person Pack-Strap Carry in which the rescuer places the survivor’s arms over his or her\nshoulders and grabs the survivor’s wrists over his or her chest, then hoists the survivor by\nbending over slightly.\nTwo-Person Carry\nSurvivor removal is easier when multiple rescuers are available. The survivor’s upper\nbody will weigh more than his or her lower body; therefore, position rescuers with\ngreater body strength at the survivor’s upper body. Two rescuers working together can\nremove a survivor using a two-person carry.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-23\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nRescuer 1: Squat at the survivor’s head and grasp the survivor from behind around the\nmidsection. Reach under the arms and grasp the survivor's left wrist with rescuer’s right\nhand, and vice versa. Crossing the wrists creates a more secure hold on the survivor,\npulling their arms and elbows closer to their body. This will be helpful if rescuers need to\ncarry the survivor through any narrow passages.\nRescuer 2: Squat between the survivor's knees, facing either toward or away from the\nsurvivor. Note that, if the rescuers will carry the survivor over uneven areas such as\nstairs, the rescuers will need to face each other. Grasp the outside of the survivor's legs\nat the knees.\nBoth rescuers: Rise to a standing position simultaneously, keeping backs straight and\nlifting with the legs. Walk the survivor to safety.\nImage 7.6: Two-Person Carry\nTwo-person Carry in which Rescuer 1 squats at the survivor’s head and grasps the survivor from\nbehind at the midsection. Rescuer 1 should use his right hand to grab the survivor’s right wrist,\nand vice versa. Rescuer 2 squats between the survivor’s knees, grasping the outside of the knees.\nBoth rescuers rise to the standing position. *\nChair Carry\nTwo rescuers can also remove a survivor by seating him or her on a chair:\nRescuer 1: Cross the survivor’s arms in his or her lap. Facing the back of the chair,\ngrasp the back upright.\nRescuer 2: Grasp the two front legs of the chair.\nBoth rescuers: Tilt the chair back, lift simultaneously, and walk out.\nIt is best to use a sturdy, non-swivel chair for this lift.\n*Note: If rescuers will need to carry the survivor over uneven surfaces, such as stairs,\nthe rescuers must face each other.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-24\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.7: Chair Carry\nChair Carry in which the survivor is placed in a sturdy, non-swivel chair and tilted backwards as\nrescuers lift the survivor. This lift requires two rescuers. If possible, secure the survivor to the\nchair. *\nBlanket Carry\nUse the blanket carry for survivors you cannot remove by other means. The blanket\ncarry requires four to six rescuers to ensure stability for the survivor and one rescuer\ndesignated the lead person:\nStep 1: Position a blanket next to the survivor, ensuring that the blanket will extend\nunder the survivor’s head.\nStep 2: Tuck the blanket under the survivor and assist the survivor in moving to the\ncenter of the blanket. If necessary, use the log rolling technique to position them on the\nblanket.\nStep 3: With three rescuers squatting on each side, roll up the edges of the blanket\nagainst the survivor to grasp a “handle.\" The lead person checks the team for even\nweight distribution and correct lifting position.\nStep 4: The lead person calls out, \"Ready to lift on the count of three: One, two, three,\nlift.\"\nStep 5: The team lifts and stands in unison—keeping the survivor level—and carries the\nsurvivor feet first.\n*Note: that if rescuers will need to carry the survivor over uneven surfaces, such as\nstairs, the rescuers must face each other.\nThe team must also lower the survivor together, using the following steps:\nStep 1: The lead person calls out, \"Ready to lower on the count of three: One, two,\nthree, lower.\"\nStep 2: The team lowers the survivor in unison, exercising caution to keep the survivor\nlevel.\nYou can use a variety of materials — such as blankets, carpets, and folded tables — as\nimprovised stretchers.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-25\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nLog Rolling\nRescuers should use the “log rolling” technique to move survivors with a suspected or\nconfirmed cervical spine injury. If the survivor is unconscious, assume he or she has a\ncervical spine injury. The rescuer at a survivor’s head should give commands as fellow\nrescuers roll the survivor as a single unit onto the blanket, backboard, or other support.\nDrag/Blanket Drag\nWhen a rescuer is not able to carry a survivor, they can drag the survivor by grasping\neither the feet or the shoulders and dragging him or her clear of the hazard. If a blanket\nis available, use the blanket drag by following these steps:\nStep 1: Wrap the survivor in a blanket.\nStep 2: Squat down and grasp an edge of the blanket. Step 3: Drag the survivor across\nthe floor.\nImage 7.8: Correct Drag Technique\nCorrect drag technique, showing the rescuer grasping the survivor by either the feet or shoulders\nand dragging him or her clear of the hazard.\nImage 7.9 - Blanket Drag\nBlanket drag, showing the survivor wrapped in a blanket with the rescuer squatting at the\nsurvivor’s head.

Break into teams of seven.\n2. Members of your team will volunteer to be “survivors” that other team members\nwill move using the drags and carries demonstrated in the class.\n3. Use chairs and other items as needed to perform the drags and carries.\n4. Be sure to trade off “survivor” and “rescuer” roles so that everyone on your team\nhas a chance to practice the drags and carries.\n5. Remember to know your limits! Do not attempt any lift or carry that will not be\nsafe for you and the survivor.\nExercise 7.4: Survivor Extrication\nPurpose: This exercise will provide you with an opportunity to practice the removal of\nentrapped survivors from a damage site, using leveraging/cribbing and drags and\ncarries.\nInstructions:\n1. Break into teams of seven.\n2. Your team will be directed to a “collapse site.” Consider your plan of action.\n3. Enter the “collapse site” and conduct a room search. Locate survivors and make\na plan for extricating them from the debris.\n4. Use leveraging and cribbing procedures as needed to free the survivor.\n5. Use appropriate lifts and drags to remove survivors from the room (and, if\npossible, from the building).\n6. If there is a second “collapse site,” conduct another rescue operation.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-27\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nUNIT 7 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• Base the decision to attempt a rescue on:\n― The risks involved; and\n― Achievement of the overall goal of doing the greatest good for the greatest\nnumber.\n• The objectives of interior and exterior search and rescue are to:\n― Maintain rescuer safety at all times;\n― Rescue the greatest number of people in the shortest amount of time;\n― Get the walking wounded and ambulatory survivors out first; and\n― Rescue the lightly trapped survivors next.\n• Remember that CERTs are restricted to light search and rescue. Your mission\nwhen dealing with heavily damaged structures or situations that are clearly\nunsafe (e.g., rising or swiftly moving water) is to warn others.\n• Search and rescue size-up follows the same process as other CERT size-up\noperations. Size-up continues throughout search and rescue efforts and provides\ninformation about how to proceed. Remember: the CERT mission is to ensure\nsafety and organization during the evaluation. Therefore, if the size-up indicates\nthat evacuation of the team is necessary, do so immediately.\n• When the decision to begin search operations is made, CERT searchers must:\n― Remember that the first priority is volunteer safety;\n― Employ appropriate search techniques; and\n― Locate any survivors and check for life threatening injuries.\n• Locating survivors means completing a size-up of the building interior to identify\nareas of entrapment, then conducting a search that:\n― Is systematic and thorough;\n― Avoids unnecessary duplication of effort; and\n― Documents results.\n• Rescue involves these main functions:\n― Moving objects and debris to create a safe rescue environment and free\nsurvivors;\n― Assessing or stabilizing survivors by checking for life-threatening\nconditions (airway obstruction, severe bleeding, and low body\ntemperature); and\n― Removing survivors as safely and as quickly as possible based on the\nsize-up.\n• Remember that rescuer safety is always the top priority.\n• Rescue operations hinge on maintaining rescuer safety, which requires CERT\nvolunteers to recognize their own limitations. CERT volunteers should never\nattempt anything that exceeds their limitations at that point in time.\n• Rescuers may leverage and crib to lift heavy debris and give access to trapped\nsurvivors.\n• Rescuers can remove survivors in several ways, depending on:\n― Their condition;\nAugust 2019 Page 7-28\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n― The number of rescuers available;\n― The strength and ability of the rescuers; and\n― The stability of the environment.\n• Stabilize survivors with suspected head or spinal injuries on some type of\nbackboard before removing. When possible, defer these removals to trained\nEMS personnel.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiar with the unit covered in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-29\n\n\nCERT Unit

Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 8 OVERVIEW\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Define terrorism;\n2. List the eight signs of terrorism and describe how to report suspicious activity;\n3. Explain the role of a CERT volunteer during a terrorist incident; and\n4. Describe activities to prepare for a terrorist incident at home, at work, and in the\ncommunity.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: TERRORIST GOALS AND TACTICS\nThe U.S. Department of Justice’s definition of terrorism:\n“The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to\nintimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment\nthereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”\nTerrorism may be perpetrated by foreign or domestic individuals or groups and\nalthough the results are similar, these groups may select different targets and\nuse different tactics to achieve their goals.\nTerrorist Goals\nTerrorists use violence to influence government policy and to achieve specific objectives\nfor their cause. Attacks are intended to undermine the public’s sense of safety and their\nconfidence in the government. Attackers seek to portray the government as ineffective,\nweak, and/or otherwise incapable.\nTerrorist attacks are often perpetrated by ideological extremists who are prepared to die\nin what they consider a symbolic sacrifice or act of martyrdom. Attackers frequently\nexploit social media seeking to spread misinformation and broadcast their actions to\naudiences around the globe, with the desire of increasing fear while simultaneously\nbolstering their credibility and legitimacy with like-minded supporters.\nNew Tactics\nRecently, terrorist attacks have trended away from large resource intensive plots such\nas the September 11 attacks to more decentralized, less sophisticated attacks like\nthose in Paris, France in 2016. Attackers have favored smaller, less centrally controlled\nnetworks, using more simplistic and accessible means such as guns and homemade\nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs). These components are easier to acquire, control,\nand conceal than large high-yield explosives, biological, radiological, or nuclear devices.\nAlthough there is always some risk from CBRNE type incidents and the United States\nremains vigilant against these threats, it is difficult to obtain and deploy these types of\nweapons.\nActive Shooter\nAn Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people\nin a confined and populated area. In most cases, active shooters use firearms(s) and\nthere is no pattern or method to their selection of targets. Active shooter situations are\nunpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law\nenforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate harm to survivors.\nMany recent terrorist attacks have included armed individuals with some training\nindiscriminately shooting civilians; although the motivations are different than a single\nactive shooter, the results are similar: rapidly accumulating casualties in a contained\nspace.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nImprovised Explosive Devices\nAn IED attack is the use of a “homemade” bomb and/or destructive device to destroy,\nincapacitate, harass, or distract. Because they are improvised, IEDs can come in many\nforms, ranging from a small pipe bomb to a sophisticated device capable of causing\nmassive damage and loss of life.\nTerrorist networks both domestic and abroad have published numerous sets of\ninstructions on how to make homemade explosives. IEDs consist of a variety of\ncomponents that include an initiator, switch, main charge, power source, and a\ncontainer. IEDs can be worn (belts, vests), carried (bags, backpacks, containers of all\nsizes/types), or transported in a vehicle; placed or thrown by a person; delivered in a\npackage; or concealed on the roadside.\nTo gain a better understanding of the impact that IEDs can have, the table below\nillustrates the damage radius cause by various sizes and types of IEDs.\nImage 8.1: IED Impact\nIEDs may be surrounded by or packed with additional materials or “enhancements”\nsuch as nails, glass, or metal fragments designed to increase the amount of shrapnel\npropelled by the explosion to maximize casualties. Enhancements may also include\nother elements such as hazardous materials. An IED can be initiated by a variety of\nmethods depending on the intended target.\nComplex Coordinated Terrorist Attacks\nA complex coordinated terrorist attack is a synchronized attack, conducted by two or\nmore semi-independent teams at multiple locations in close succession, initiated with\nlittle or no warning, using well trained attackers and employing one or more of the\nfollowing: fire arms, explosives, and fire as a weapon.\nAs seen in Paris, France in 2016, attackers have coordinated their actions to hit multiple\ntargets nearly simultaneously. When conducting these attacks, there may be pre-\nplanned coordination as well as real-time coordination between attackers. These\nattacks can be extremely lethal in a relatively short period of time.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nCyber Attacks\nAnother type of terrorist weapon is deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer\nnetworks. This is known as cyberterrorism. To help guard against cyberterrorism, it is\nimportant that computer users implement appropriate security measures.\nCybersecurity involves protecting infrastructure by preventing, detecting, and\nresponding to cyber incidents. Unlike physical threats that prompt immediate action—\nlike stop, drop, and roll in the event of a fire—cyber threats are often difficult to identify\nand comprehend. Among these dangers are viruses erasing entire systems, intruders\nbreaking into systems and altering files, intruders using your computer or device to\nattack others, or intruders stealing confidential information. The spectrum of cyber risks\nis limitless. Threats, some more serious and sophisticated than others, can have wide-\nranging effects at the individual, community, organizational, and national levels.\n• Organized cybercrime, state-sponsored hackers, and cyber espionage can pose\nnational security risks to our country.\n• Transportation, power, and other services may be disrupted by large-scale cyber\nincidents. The extent of the disruption will be determined by many factors such\nas the target and size of the incident.\n• Vulnerability to data breach and loss increases if an organization’s network is\ncompromised. Information about a company, its employees, and its customers\ncan be at risk.\n• Individually-owned devices such as computers, tablets, mobile phones, and\ngaming systems that connect to the Internet are vulnerable to intrusion. Personal\ninformation may be at risk without proper security.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: PREPARING YOUR COMMUNITY\nIf You See Something, Say Something: Potential Indicators\nWe all have a responsibility to play an active role in keeping the country safe. The\nphrase, “If you see something, say something,” took on additional power after the foiled\nTimes Square bomb plot in New York City. On May 1, 2010, street vendors in Times\nSquare noticed a smoking SUV with its blinkers on, engine running, and no one inside.\nThey decided to say something to a police officer. Thousands of people cleared from\nthe area while the bomb was dismantled.\nEight Signs of Terrorism\nThe presence of even a few signs may indicate the possibility of a terrorist attack. It is\nimportant to understand what these signs may look like as they are executed so you are\nable to identify them within your community. If you recognize one of these signs being\nacted out, it is important to contact your local law enforcement and effectively\ncommunicate the suspicious activity that you have identified. The FBI’s Suspicious\nActivity Reporting (SAR) tip line (https://tips.fbi.gov/) is an avenue for reporting any\nsuspicious activities.\nSigns exhibited by potential terrorists (often in this order) include:\n• Surveillance: The targeted area is being watched and studied carefully. This\nmay include recording or monitoring activities.\n• Elicitation: Information is gathered that is specific to the intended target. This\nmay be by mail, phone, or in person.\n• Tests of Security: Local security measures are tested and analyzed, including\nmeasuring reaction times to security breaches or attempts to penetrate security.\n• Funding: Raising, transferring, and spending money, which may include selling\ndrugs or stolen merchandise, human trafficking, and funneling money through\nbusinesses or charities.\n• Acquiring Supplies: Necessary supplies are gathered to prepare the attack,\nincluding weapons/weapon components, transportation, and communications.\nSupplies may be purchased with cash only.\n• Impersonation or Suspicious People Who Do Not Belong: People\nimpersonating roles to gain access or information and people who don’t fit in or\ndon’t seem to belong in the location.\n• Rehearsal and Dry Runs: Groups or individuals will often map out routes,\ndetermine traffic flow and timing ahead of time, and can also operate test runs\nbefore the actual attack.\n• Deployment: The final and most urgent phase when terrorists are deploying\nassets and getting into position. Attack is imminent.\nAlthough it is not the mission of CERT volunteers to keep constant watch for these\nsigns, everyone should be alert to changes in their environment as a clue to a possible\nterrorist attack and report suspicious activities to appropriate authorities.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nPotential Targets in Your Community\nWhile hardened targets, such as government buildings, military installations, and\ninfrastructure (e.g., power grids and dams) remain viable targets for certain groups,\nattacks have trended towards easier, less secure targets. Terrorists have frequently\nselected soft targets like schools, parks, large gathering spaces, cafés, and concert\nhalls. Although differently motivated, active shooters in the United States have also\nselected less secure targets like malls, movie theatres, and universities. Smaller, less\ninvolved plots still generate high casualties and allow the attackers to achieve their\nobjectives with fewer resources.\nPreparedness\nTerrorist attacks frequently occur without warning; however, being alert, reporting\nsuspicious activities, and taking general preparedness steps, such as having a plan to\ncommunicate with loved ones, will help you if one does occur. If you believe a terrorist\nattack is imminent, call 9-1-1 and follow the instructions provided.\nExercise 8.1: Preparing for a Terrorism-Related Event\nPurpose: As with all types of disasters and emergencies, preparation is key to planning\nfor a terrorism-related event. Although it is often difficult to predict when such an event\nmay occur, there are several steps that you can take today to be prepared.\nInstructions:\n1. Break into small table groups.\n2. As a group, create a list of activities that CERT volunteers can do at home or\nwork to better prepare for a terrorism related emergency. Be prepared to share\nyour list with the rest of the class.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATIONS\nAs introduced in Section 1, active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolve\nquickly.\nHow to Respond When an Active Shooter is in Your Vicinity\nQuickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your own life. Remember that\ncustomers and clients are likely to follow the lead of employees and managers during\nan active shooter situation.\n1. RUN\nIf there is an accessible escape path, attempt to evacuate the premises. Be sure to:\n• Have an escape route and plan in mind ahead of time;\n• Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow;\n• Leave your belongings behind;\n• Help others escape, if possible;\n• Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be, if\npossible;\n• Keep your hands visible;\n• Follow the instructions of any police officers; and\n• Call 9-1-1 when you are safe.\n2. HIDE\nIf evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less\nlikely to find you. Your hiding place should:\n• Be out of the active shooter’s view;\n• Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., an office with a\nclosed and locked door); and\n• Not trap you or restrict your options for movement.\nTo prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place:\n• Lock the door; and\n• Blockade the door with heavy furniture.\nIf the active shooter is nearby:\n• Lock the door;\n• Silence your cell phone and/or pager;\n• Turn off any source of noise (e.g., radios, televisions);\n• Hide behind large items (e.g., cabinets, desks); and\n• Remain quiet.\nIf evacuation and hiding out are not possible:\n• Remain calm;\n• Dial 9 -1-1, if possible, to alert police to the active shooter’s location; and\n• If you cannot speak, leave the line open and allow the dispatcher to listen.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\n3. FIGHT\nIf you are unable to run, evacuate or hide and when your life is in imminent danger,\nyou may attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter by:\n• Taking decisive action;\n• Acting as aggressively as possible against him/her;\n• Throwing items and improvising weapons;\n• Yelling; and\n• Committing to your actions.\nHow to Respond When Law Enforcement Arrives\nLaw enforcement’s purpose is to stop the active shooter as soon as possible. Officers\nwill proceed directly to the shooting without stopping to render aid to the survivors.\n• Officers may arrive in teams;\n• Officers may wear street clothes, regular patrol uniforms, or external bulletproof\nvests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment;\n• Officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, and/or handguns; and\n• Officers may shout commands and may push individuals to the ground for their\nsafety.\nHow to react when law enforcement arrives:\n• Try to remain calm;\n• Follow officers’ instructions;\n• Put down any items in your hands (e.g., bags, jackets);\n• Immediately raise hands and spread fingers;\n• Keep hands visible at all times;\n• Avoid making quick movements toward officers such as holding on to them;\n• Avoid pointing, screaming, and/or yelling; and\n• Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating, just proceed in\nthe direction from which officers are entering the premises.\nInformation to provide to law enforcement or 9-1-1 operator:\n• Location of the active shooter(s);\n• Number of shooters, if more than one;\n• Physical description of shooter(s);\n• Number and type of weapons held by the shooter(s); and\n• Number of potential targets at the location.\nThe first officers to arrive to the scene will not stop to help injured persons. Expect\nrescue teams comprised of additional officers and emergency medical personnel to\nfollow the initial officers. These rescue teams will treat and remove any injured persons.\nThey may also call upon able-bodied individuals to assist in removing the wounded from\nthe premises.\nOnce you have reached a safe location or an assembly point, you will likely be held in\nthat area by law enforcement until the situation is under control, and all witnesses have\nAugust 2019 Page 8-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nbeen identified and questioned. Do not leave until law enforcement authorities have\ninstructed you to do so.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: UNTIL HELP ARRIVES\nCERT volunteers are NOT equipped or trained to respond to terrorist incidents. CERT\nvolunteers should in no way activate or respond to an incident in their community.\nHowever, while highly unlikely, it is possible that you may find yourself in a situation that\nyou believe to be a terrorist attack. In this rare circumstance, CERT volunteers have a\ndeveloped skillset to provide care until help arrives.\nLike in any other situation, volunteers should follow the direction of law enforcement and\nfirst responders. You should be mindful of your limits and recognize that your safety is\nyour top priority. Stay safe. Do not put yourself at risk but save lives if you can.\nIf you are willing and able to assist, remember the most important life-saving\ninterventions, recognize what the stress of the situation can do to you, and understand\nthe physical impact of being in a potential terrorist situation.\nTreating Others\nIf you believe you are able to help those around you, focus on the lifesaving\ninterventions that were covered in Unit 3.\n• Stop Bleeding: The average person has approximately five liters of blood.\nSevere blood loss can result in irreversible shock. This means that if you lose\nabout half of your body’s blood supply, no matter what anyone does to try to save\nyou, death is unavoidable. You must get bleeding under control as soon as\npossible. The first way to control severe bleeding is through applying direct\npressure. For more information on controlling bleeding, please refer to page 3-4\nof the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Maintain Body Temperature: It is important to maintain the patient’s body\ntemperature. If necessary, place a blanket or other material under and/or over\nthe patient to provide protection from extreme ground temperatures (hot or cold).\nPeople with very serious injuries are more susceptible to hypothermia, which can\nincrease the risk of death. For more information on maintaining body\ntemperature, please refer to page 3-5 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Opening the Airway: Positioning an injured patient to keep their airway open\nand clear is critical to saving their life. The best position for the body is one in\nwhich the chest can expand fully and the airway is not at risk of being obstructed.\nIn other words, the best position is one in which the tongue cannot flop back into\nthe individual’s throat and one in which blood or fluid does not end up in the\nlungs (aspirated), particularly in the case with someone with facial trauma. There\nare different ways to position an injured patient to keep their airway open\ndepending on if the patient is conscious or unconscious. For more information on\nopening the airway, please refer to page 3-7 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Providing Comfort: CERT volunteers can be of great value to injured and\nemotional patient simply by offering comfort and support. No special skills are\nneeded—just a calm and reassuring presence. For more information on providing\ncomfort, please refer to page 3-9 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nYou must make the best decisions possible with the information that you have at hand.\nEven if an incident turns out not to be terrorist related, you have made the right decision\nif you have done the most good for the greatest number and have not been injured.\nRecognizing Stress\nBefore you step forward to help it is important to recognize how the stress of the\nsituation may affect you. In any life-threatening situation, you will feel fear and this fear\nwill impact your mind and body. It is important for you to be aware of what may happen,\nso you can recognize these responses as a normal part of your body’s response to\nstress. It is normal to experience certain physical and psychological changes.\nRecognize that:\n• Fear is typically at its peak once we comprehend the danger of the situation;\n• Fear has profound effects on the mind and body; and\n• Fear can influence action.\nPhysical Impact\nExplosions create a high-pressure blast that sends debris flying and lifts people off the\nground. The type of injuries and the number of people hurt will vary depending on: the\nphysical environment and the size of the blast, the amount of shielding between people\nand the blast, fires or structural damage that result from the explosion, and whether the\nexplosion occurs in a closed space or an open area. Injuries common to explosions\ninclude:\n• Overpressure damage to the lungs, ears, abdomen, and other pressure sensitive\norgans. Blast lung injury, a condition caused by the extreme pressure of an\nexplosion, is the leading cause of illness and death for initial survivors of an\nexplosion.\n• Fragmentation injuries caused by projectiles thrown by the blast—material from\nthe bomb, shrapnel, or flying debris that penetrates the body and causes\ndamage.\n• Impact injuries are caused when the blast throws a person into another object\ncausing serious injuries, including fractures, amputation, and trauma to the head\nand neck.\n• Thermal injuries caused by burns to the skin, mouth, sinuses, and lungs.\n• Other injuries including exposure to toxic substances, crush injuries, and\naggravation of pre-existing conditions (e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure).\nRemember life-saving interventions for controlling bleeding, maintaining body\ntemperature, and opening airways that were taught in Unit 3: Disaster Medical\nOperations Part 1.\nSecondary Attacks\nTerrorist attacks, especially those involving explosives, may include a secondary wave\ntargeting those who are providing care to the injured. Be highly aware of your\nsurroundings and move away from danger as soon as you are able. If you can do so,\ntake others with you.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nA bomb explosion can cause secondary explosions if gasoline, natural gas, or other\nflammable material is ignited. Secondary hazards that result can include fire with\npossibly toxic smoke, disruption of electric power, ruptured natural gas lines and water\nmains, and debris. There can be loss of traffic control in the blast area with possible\ntraffic accidents involving fleeing citizens.\nWhat Professional Responders Will Do\nThere are several measures that you can expect professional responders to take when\nthey arrive at the scene of a terrorist incident.\nSize-up\nThe first step that professional responders will take when they arrive at the scene is to\nconduct a thorough size-up. They will follow steps that are very similar to those that\nCERTs take to determine:\n• What is going on;\n• How bad the situation is and how much worse it could get;\n• What measures can be taken to control the incident safely; and\n• What resources will be needed.\nEstablish Zones\nCERTs can expect professional responders to treat some terrorist incidents the same\nas hazardous materials incidents. As such, the next step that they will take is to\nestablish three incident zones.\n1. The Hot Zone is referred to as the incident scene and the contaminated area\naround the scene.\n2. The Warm Zone in a decontamination situation would be upwind (and upstream\nif the contaminant is waterborne) from the Hot Zone and is used to isolate\nsurvivors during decontamination. In a non-decontamination situation, such as a\nterrorist attack, the warm zone will be the area immediately outside of the\nincident scene.\n3. The Cold Zone is located beyond the Warm Zone. Survivors will be evacuated to\nthe Cold Zone and kept there until professional responders authorize them to\nleave.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 6: HAZMAT AND CBRNE\nIt is highly unlikely that CERT volunteers will find themselves working within a Hazmat\nor CBRNE incident. However, there are some basic guidelines that can be noted for\nthese types of incidents.\nBasic HAZMAT Decontamination Procedures\nThe objective of decontamination is to remove harmful chemicals or particles of\nradioactive dirt or dust that have come in contact with the skin or clothes.\n• Leave the contaminated area immediately. Depending on the circumstances, go\ninside, go outside, or go upwind, uphill, or upstream from the contaminant. (Seek\na distance of at least 1,000 to 1,500 feet.)\n• Take decontamination action. Seconds count! The goal is to limit the time that\nthe agent is in contact with the skin.\n― Remove everything from the body, including jewelry. Cut off clothing that\nwould normally be removed over the head to reduce the probability of\ninhaling or ingesting the agent. Seal your clothes in a plastic bag.\n― Wash hands before using them to shower. If no shower is available,\nimprovise with water from faucets or bottled water.\n― Flush the entire body, including the eyes, underarms, and groin area, with\ncopious amounts of cool water. Hot water opens the pores of the skin and\ncan promote absorption of the contaminant. Using copious amounts of\nwater is important because some chemicals react to small amounts of\nwater.\nIf soap is immediately available, mix the soap with water for decontamination. Avoid\nscrubbing with soap because scrubbing can rub the chemical into the skin rather than\nremove it.\nWash hair with soap or shampoo or rinse with water if soap is not available. Do not use\nconditioner as that can bind radioactive materials to your hair and make it difficult to\nremove.\nIf hosing someone else off or pouring water from a container, avoid both physical\ncontact with the person and with the runoff.\nThe water used for decontamination must be contained and covered or drained outside\nof the shelter area to avoid shelter contamination.\nBlot dry using an absorbent cloth. Do not rub the skin! Put on clean clothes.\nAs soon as possible, emergency responders will set up mass decontamination\ncapabilities. For radiological events, stations for radiation monitoring and blood tests will\nalso be set up to determine levels of exposure and what next steps to take to protect\nhealth.\nCBRNE\nCBRNE stands for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive.\nThese events have the capability to cause mass casualties and cause great public\nAugust 2019 Page 8-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nunrest. The anthrax letter attacks in 2001 are an example of how effective and\ndisrupting a CBRNE attack could be. The threat of CBRNE attacks has become less\nlikely as terrorists have moved on to new tactics, as discussed earlier in this unit.\nA CBRNE incident differs from a hazardous material incident in both scope (i.e.,\nCBRNE can be a mass casualty situation) and intent. CBRNE incidents are responded\nto under the assumption that they are intentional and malicious.\nCBRNE Indicators\nIt is important to be alert to changes in the environment as a clue to a possible terrorist\nattack.\nWhile bombs and explosions have obvious immediate effects, biological or chemical\nattacks may not be as immediately noticeable. Indicators that a biological or chemical\nattack has occurred or is underway could include:\n• Vapor clouds or mists that are unusual for the area or for the time of day.\n• Out of place and unattended packages, boxes, or vehicles. Items that are out of\nplace and unattended could signal a possible terrorist attack. This could include\nchemical or biological agents as well as explosives.\nIf you observe any of these indicators of a terrorist incident, you should:\n• Not touch it;\n• Move away from the object or area; and\n• Report it to authorities immediately.\nNuclear Attack\nA nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear\nreaction. All nuclear devices cause deadly effects when exploded, including blinding\nlight, intense heat, initial nuclear radiation, blast, fires started by the heat pulse,\nsecondary fires caused by the destruction, and widespread radioactive material that can\ncontaminate the air, water, and ground surfaces for miles around.\nA nuclear device can range from a weapon carried by an intercontinental ballistic\nmissile launched by a hostile nation or terrorist organization, to a small portable nuclear\ndevice transported by an individual.\nIn the very unlikely event you believe you are in a nuclear attack or exposed to\nradiation, there are three factors that significantly affect your safety after the incident:\ntime, distance, and shielding. A critical protective action in a radiological or nuclear\nevent is to get inside as quickly as possible, stay inside, and stay tuned to local radio or\ntelevision stations for further guidance.\n• Stay Inside (time): Limiting the amount of time in the area of an incident is\nimportant to limit exposure to radioactive fallout resulting from the explosion.\nRemain inside until you receive notification from authorities that it is safe to leave\nthe building. In most cases, be prepared to shelter inside for a few days.\nHowever, sheltering may be necessary for as long as a month.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\n• Go Deep Inside (distance/shielding): It is important to find adequate shelter\nquickly to avoid radioactive fallout resulting from the explosion. Get inside as\nsoon as possible and go to the farthest interior room or to a basement. Flat roofs\ncollect fallout particles, so the top floor is not a good choice, nor is a floor\nadjacent to a neighboring flat roof. The more distance between you and the\nfallout particles, the better.\nIf you are outside when the event occurs, do not look at the flash or fire ball. It can blind\nyou. Take cover behind anything that will offer protection, lie flat, and cover your head. If\nthe explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast\nwave to hit. Get inside as soon as you can.\nShelter-in-Place\nYou may receive direction from law enforcement to shelter-in-place. Depending on the\nnature of the threat (if it is chemical or biological), this may involve sealing yourself into\na room. Procedures for sheltering in place during a chemical or biological attack include:\n• Shut off the ventilation system and latch all doors and windows to reduce airflow\nfrom the outside.\n• Go to your shelter-in-place room (where your precut plastic, duct tape, radio, and\nother supplies should be stored).\n• Use precut plastic sheeting to cover openings where air can enter the room,\nincluding doors, windows, vents, electrical outlets, and telephone outlets. When\ncut, the sheeting should extend several inches beyond the dimensions of the\ndoor or window to allow room to duct tape the sheeting to the walls and floor.\n• Tape the plastic sheeting around all doors and windows using duct tape to\nensure a good seal.\n• Seal with duct tape other areas where air can come in, such as under doors and\nareas where pipes enter the home. Air can be blocked by placing towels or other\nsoft objects in areas where air could enter, then securing them with duct tape.\n• Chemicals used in an attack will be carried on the wind and will dissipate over\ntime. You will generally not need to stay in a sealed room for more than a few\nhours. Monitor Emergency Alert System broadcasts to know when it is safe to\nleave the safe room.\n• After contaminants have cleared, open windows and vents and turn on fans to\nprovide ventilation.\nTo be able to execute these procedures during an actual event, requires that you:\n• Store precut plastic sheeting in your identified shelter-in-place room.\n• Assemble and store food, water, and a battery-operated radio in the shelter-in-\nplace room.\n• Practice sealing the room.\n• Establish shelter-in-place procedures wherever you spend significant amounts of\ntime at home, at work, and/or at school.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nAs a rule of thumb, 10 square feet of floor space per person will provide sufficient air to\nprevent carbon dioxide buildup for up to 5 hours, assuming a normal breathing rate\nwhile resting.\nIf the threat is a violent individual(s), shelter-in-place may be referred to as a lockout\nand you may be asked to lock yourself into a safe space by doing the following:\n• Lock exterior doors.\n• Clear hallways, restrooms, and other rooms that cannot be secured.\n• Move all persons away from windows. Secure and cover windows, if able.\n• Make only essential communications and avoid any broadcasts about the\nmovement, location, or status of law enforcement in the area.\n• Once the threat has subsided, law enforcement announces, “all clear” and\noperations can return to normal.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nUNIT 8 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• The definition of terrorism, as defined by the Department of Justice, is the\n“unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or\ncoerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in\nfurtherance of political or social objectives.” Terrorism may be perpetrated by\nforeign or domestic individuals or groups.\n• When terrorists attack, their goals are to:\n― Create mass casualties;\n― Disrupt critical resources, vital services, and the economy; and\n― Cause fear.\n• Terrorists have moved away from large, resource-intensive plots to complex,\ncoordinated attacks like those in Paris, France in 2016.\n• New tactics include active shooter events and detonating improvised explosive\ndevices, sometimes occurring simultaneously in coordinated attacks. In addition,\nan evolving terrorist tactic is cyberterrorism.\n• An Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill\npeople in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use\nfirearms(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of targets. Active\nshooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate\ndeployment of law enforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate\nharm to survivors.\n• Run, Hide, Fight is the best way to respond if an active shooter is in your vicinity.\n• An IED attack is the use of a “homemade” bomb and/or destructive device to\ndestroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. Because they are improvised, IEDs can\ncome in many forms, ranging from a small pipe bomb to a sophisticated device\ncapable of causing massive damage and loss of life.\n• CERT volunteers, along with the public, play a critical role in identifying\nsuspicious activities occurring within the community. There are typically eight\nsigns of terrorism that signal potential terrorist activity. If identified and\ncommunicated correctly to local law enforcement, suspicious activities\nsurrounding the potential possibility of a terrorist attack can be stopped. The\neight signs of terrorism are:\n― Surveillance;\n― Elicitation;\n― Tests of security;\n― Funding;\n― Acquiring supplies;\n― Impersonation or suspicious people who don’t belong;\n― Rehearsal and dry runs; and\n― Deployment.\n• Terrorist attacks frequently occur without warning; however, being alert, reporting\nsuspicious activities, and taking general preparedness steps, such as having a\nplan to communicate with loved ones, will help you if one does occur. If you\nAugust 2019 Page 8-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nbelieve a terrorist attack is imminent, call 9-1-1 and follow the instructions\nprovided.\n• CERT volunteers are NOT equipped or trained to response to terrorist incidents.\nCERT volunteers should in no way activate or respond to an incident in their\ncommunity.\n• While highly unlikely, it is possible that you may find yourself in a situation that\nyou believe is a terrorist attack. Like in any other situation, be mindful of your\nlimits and recognize that your safety is your top priority. Stay safe. Do not put\nyourself at risk but save lives if you can.\n• It is important to be alert to changes in the environment as a clue to possible\nCBRNE attack.\n― Vapor clouds or mists that are unusual for the area or for the time of day.\n― Out of place and unattended packages, boxes, or vehicles. Items that are\nout of place and unattended could signal a possible terrorist attack. This\ncould include chemical or biological agents as well as explosives.\n• If you observe any of these indicators:\n― Do not touch it;\n― Move away from the area; and\n― Report it to authorities immediately.\nHomework Assignment\nReview the materials to be presented in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 9: Course\nReview, Final Exam, and\nDisaster Simulation\nParticipant

I’m heading in that direction now.”\nB. “I am a CERT member, but I have to wait for an official to declare a\ndisaster before I can activate.”\nC. “I’m not part of the Terrorist Response Team.”\nD. “You’re right. I am a CERT member, but CERT members must not\nrespond to a potential terrorist incident.”\nAugust 2019 Page 9-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 9: Course Review, Final Exam, and Disaster Simulation Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: DISASTER SIMULATION\nPurpose: This simulation will give you a chance to apply many of the skills you learned\nduring the earlier sessions.\nInstructions:\n1. Break into four groups.\n2. The simulation will be conducted across four stations.\n3. At Station 1, each group will receive the disaster simulation. Based on that\nscenario, you will:\n• Determine the extent of damage\n• Establish team priorities\n• Determine the resources needed\n• Identify potential hazards\n4. While at Station 1, your group will select a CERT Team Leader who will establish\na CERT organization based on resources available and establish priorities.\n5. At Station 2, your group will be required to:\n• Evaluate a fire situation\n• Select the proper extinguisher for the situation\n• Extinguish the fire\nEach person will be required to extinguish the fire.\n6.

      "text": "CERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\nHISTORY OF THE CERT BASIC TRAINING\nThe Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program is a nationally\nsupported, locally implemented initiative that teaches people how to better prepare\nthemselves for hazards that may affect their communities. CERT trains them in basic\ndisaster response skills such as team organization, disaster medical operations, fire\nsafety, and light search and rescue. Local CERT programs train and organize teams of\nvolunteers to assist their families, neighbors, co-workers, and other community\nmembers during emergencies when professional responders may not be immediately\navailable to provide assistance. Before, during, and after disasters, CERT volunteer\nteams perform basic response activities, including checking in on neighbors, distributing\ninformation to the public, supporting emergency operations centers, and helping to\nmanage traffic and crowds. The ability for CERT volunteers to perform these activities\nfrees up professional responders to focus their efforts on more complex, essential, and\ncritical tasks. CERT volunteers also support their communities by organizing, promoting,\nand participating in emergency preparedness events, activities, and projects.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) developed the CERT program after\nexamining the civilian response to disasters in Mexico and Japan in 1985. The LAFD\nrecognized that citizens are likely to be on their own during the early stages of disaster.\nUnder these circumstances, family members, co-workers, and neighbors will often\nspontaneously come to the aid of each other. While untrained volunteers can be very\neffective in aiding others, their lack of training puts them at risk for injury or death. For\nexample, during the response to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that claimed more\nthan 10,000 lives, untrained volunteers saved 700 lives, but unfortunately, 100\nvolunteers died in the process.\nIn response, the LAFD decided to develop and offer disaster response training to Los\nAngeles residents so that during and after future disasters volunteers would be able to\nassist in a safe, responsible, and effective manner. The LAFD piloted the first CERT\ntraining in 1986. In turn, other fire departments around the country, including\ncommunities where the major threat is hurricanes rather than earthquakes, adopted the\nLAFD’s training model. Building on this development, the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) expanded the CERT materials in 1994 to make them\napplicable to all hazards and made the program available to communities nationwide.\nSince that time, thousands of dedicated trainers, organizations, and citizens have\nembraced the responsibility to learn new skills and become prepared to execute safe\nand effective emergency response capabilities.\nThe National CERT Program Office would like to thank the regional, state, and local\npartners and subject matter experts who contributed to the 2019 CERT Basic Training\nupdate.\nAugust 2019 Page 1"

      "text": "CERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\nA MODEL FOR COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS\nThe CERT program is critical in the effort to engage everyone in the United States in\nmaking their communities safer, more prepared, and more resilient when incidents\noccur.\nCommunity-based preparedness planning allows us all to prepare for and respond to\nanticipated disruptions and potential hazards following a disaster. As individuals, we can\nprepare our homes and families to cope during that critical period. Through pre-event\nplanning, neighborhoods, and worksites can also work together to help reduce injuries,\nloss of lives, and property damage. Neighborhood preparedness will enhance the ability\nof individuals and communities to reduce their emergency needs and to manage their\nexisting resources until professional assistance becomes available.\nStudies of behavior following disasters have shown that groups working together in the\ndisaster period perform more effectively if there has been prior planning and training for\ndisaster response. These studies also show that organized grassroots efforts may be\nmore successful if they are woven into the social and political fabric of the community—\nneighborhood associations, schools, workplaces, places of worship, and other existing\norganizations.\nEffective response, therefore, requires comprehensive planning and coordination of all\nwho will be involved—government, volunteer groups, private businesses, schools, and\ncommunity organizations. With training and information, individuals and community\ngroups can be prepared to serve as a crucial resource capable of performing many of\nthe emergency functions needed in the immediate post-disaster period. The CERT\nprogram trains individuals to be assets to help communities prepare for effective\ndisaster response.\nWhen Disaster Strikes\nThe damage caused by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes,\nand floods, or from manmade/technological events such as explosions or hazardous\nmaterials accidents can affect all aspects of a community, from government services to\nprivate enterprise to civic activities. These events:\n• Severely restrict or overwhelm our response resources, communications,\ntransportation, and utilities; and\n• Leave many individuals and neighborhoods cut off from outside support.\nDamaged roads and disrupted communications systems may restrict the access of\nemergency response agencies into critically affected areas. Thus, for the initial period\nimmediately following a disaster—often up to three days or longer—individuals,\nhouseholds, and neighborhoods may need to rely on their own resources for:\n• Food;\n• Water; and\n• Shelter.\nIndividual preparedness, planning, survival skills, and mutual aid within neighborhoods\nand worksites during this initial period are essential measures in managing the\nAugust 2019 Page 2"

What you do today will have a critical impact on the quality of\nyour survival and your ability to help others safely and effectively. You will be more\nresilient to a potentially disruptive event by learning about the likely hazards in your\ncommunity and your community’s plans and protocols, understanding hazard-specific\nprotective actions and response skills, assembling important emergency supplies, and\nmitigating potential hazards in your home. Subsequently, you will be an important asset\nto your family, neighbors, and other members of your community.\nHow CERTS Operate\nAs each CERT is organized and trained in accordance with standard operating\nprocedures developed by the sponsoring agency, members identify potential meeting\nlocations or staging areas to be used in the event of a disaster.\nThe staging area is where the fire department and other services will interact with\nCERTs. Having a centralized contact point makes it possible to communicate damage\nassessments and allocate volunteer resources more effectively. This is true for all\nCERTs, whether active in a neighborhood, workplace, school, college/university\ncampus, or other venue.\nDamage from disasters may vary considerably from one location to another. In an\nactual disaster, communities will deploy CERTs as needs dictate. Volunteers should\nassess their own needs and the priorities of those in their immediate environment first.\nCERT volunteers who do not encounter a need in their immediate area should then\nreport to their staging area, and the first volunteer to arrive will become the initial Team\nLeader (TL) for the disaster response. The TL may pass leadership to someone else as\nother volunteers arrive. Volunteers who find themselves in a heavily impacted location\nshould send runners to staging areas to get assistance from available resources.\nVolunteers may use ham radios or similar technologies to increase communication\ncapabilities and coordination.\nCERTs provide an effective first-response capability. Acting as individuals first, then as\nteam members, trained CERT volunteers can fan-out within their assigned areas,\nextinguish small fires, turn off natural gas at damaged homes, perform light search and\nrescue, and render basic medical treatment. CERTs also act as effective “eyes and\nears” for uniformed emergency responders. Trained volunteers also offer an important\npotential workforce to service organizations in non-hazardous functions such as shelter\nsupport, crowd control, and evacuation.\nAbout the CERT Basic Training\nIf available, emergency services personnel are the best trained and equipped to handle\nemergencies. Following a catastrophic disaster, however, you and your community may\nbe isolated for an extended period for a myriad of reasons, including the size of the area\naffected, inoperable communications systems, or unpassable roads.\nCERT Basic Training prepares you to help yourself and help others in the event of a\ncatastrophic disaster. Because emergency services personnel will not be able to help\neveryone immediately, you can make a difference by using your CERT training to save\nlives and protect property.\nAugust 2019 Page 3"

It is\ncritical that all community members take steps to prepare in advance of an event.\nEffective community preparedness addresses the unique attributes of the community:\n• The threat and hazards profile and vulnerabilities of the area;\n• The existing infrastructure;\n• Resources and skills within the community; and\n• The population composition of the community.\nEffective community preparedness also engages the whole community, which includes:\n• Government leaders and the public sector;\n• Community leaders from the private and civic sectors; and\n• The public, including volunteer groups, faith-based groups, and tribal\ncommunities.\nGovernment\nGovernment has the responsibility to develop, test, and refine emergency operations\nplans; ensure emergency responders have adequate skills and resources; and provide\nservices to protect and assist its citizens. In meeting these challenges, government also\nhas the responsibility to involve the community in the planning process, to incorporate\ncommunity resources in the plans, to provide reliable, actionable information, and to\nencourage training, practicing, and volunteer programs.\nGovernment emergency service providers include professionals from the following\nfields:\n• Emergency management;\n• Emergency medical services;\n• Fire and rescue;\n• Human services;\n• Law enforcement;\n• Public health services; and\n• Public works.\nThe Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)\nAll government agencies with a role in disaster response work to organize and\ncoordinate their agencies’ activities before an emergency or disaster. The product of\ntheir work is the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for that community.\nThe EOP is a document that:\n• Assigns responsibility to organizations and individuals for carrying out specific\nactions at projected times and places in an emergency that exceeds the\ncapability or routine responsibility of any one agency (e.g., the fire department);\nAugust 2019 Page 1-3"

Their responsibilities include:\n• Participating on the local collaborative planning council to provide insights and\nperspectives reflecting their industry or the constituency they service. For\nexample, people with disabilities, local schools, communities with language or\ncultural differences, small businesses, the economically disadvantaged, and\ncommunities of faith;\n• Identifying and integrating appropriate resources into government plans; and\n• Ensuring facilities, staff, and customers or population served are prepared,\ntrained, and practiced in preparedness actions.\nThe Public\nThe public also has a responsibility for preparedness. All members of the community\nshould:\n• Learn about the community alerts and warnings, evacuation routes, and how to\nget critical information;\n• Take training in preparedness, first aid, and response skills;\n• Practice skills and personal plans through periodic drills in multiple settings;\n• Network and be able to help others;\n• Participate in community feedback opportunities;\n• Report suspicious activity; and\n• Volunteer.\nEngaging the Whole Community\nFEMA’s Whole Community approach to emergency management seeks to engage the\nfull capacity of society in a dialogue to increase disaster preparedness and resilience.\nThe full capacity of society is a reference to all of the partners within a community who\nshould engage in community preparedness, including government entities; non-\ngovernmental organizations; faith-based organizations; schools; nonprofit groups;\nprivate sector entities; and at the grass roots level, individuals, families, local\ncommunities, and social networks.\nCommunity coalitions organized collaborative bodies within a community such as\nCitizen Corps help to foster and strengthen relationships throughout the community.\nRelationships are the fabric that makes a community stronger and more resilient after\nAugust 2019 Page 1-4"

The\nscope of this CERT training does not cover pandemics. While home fires are not always\ncommunity events, Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls, does discuss them. For the\npurposes of this training, most of the hazards discussed will be natural, technological\nand accidental, or terrorism related.\nKey Elements of Disasters\nRegardless of the event, disasters have several key elements in common.\n• They are relatively unexpected, with the little or no warning or opportunity to\nprepare.\n• Increased demands for resources may initially overwhelm available response\npersonnel and emergency services.\n• They endanger lives, health, and the environment.\nIn the immediate aftermath of a disaster, needs are often greater than professional\nemergency services personnel can provide. In these instances, CERTs become a vital\nlink in the emergency service chain.\nUnderstanding Local Hazard Vulnerability\nAssessing your community’s vulnerability to hazards allows the community to prioritize\npreparedness measures and to target effective actions for the appropriate hazard. To\nassess your community’s vulnerability to hazards, it is useful to:\n• Identify the most common disasters that occur;\n• Identify possible hazards with most severe impact;\n• Consider recent and/or historical impacts;\n• Identify susceptible locations in the community for specific hazards—people,\nbuildings, infrastructure; and\n• Consider what to expect for disruption of services and length of restoration.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-6"

In the same way, during or after a disaster, emergency services\npersonnel must prioritize resources according to the highest-priority need.\n• Police will address incidents of grave public safety.\n• Firefighters will suppress major fires.\n• EMS personnel will handle life-threatening injuries. You should be aware,\nhowever, that CERTs may also handle life-threatening injuries until EMS units\nbecome available.\n• Lower-priority needs will be met in other ways.\nDamage Related to Structure Type\nIt is important to know what type of damage to expect from the main types of structures\nin the community. Engineered buildings, such as most high-rise buildings, have\nperformed well in most types of disasters. During earthquakes, flooding events (e.g.,\nhurricanes, tsunamis), and high-wind events (e.g., tornadoes, hurricanes), older high-\nrise buildings, however, are more susceptible to damage from:\n• Broken glass;\n• Falling panels; and\n• Collapsing walkways and stairways.\nKeep in mind that age, type of construction, and type of disaster are major factors in\npotential damage to detached homes and garages.\n• Tornado and hurricane damage to single-family homes can range from little\ndamage to total destruction.\n• In general, homes built prior to 1940 were not originally bolted to the foundation,\nmaking them subject to being shaken, blown, or floated off their foundations.\n• Older homes constructed of non-reinforced brick are less stable than newer\nconstruction.\n• When an event damages a structure, there is a threat of additional damage, such\nas fire from ruptured gas lines, following the event.\n• Mobile homes are most susceptible to damage because they can be displaced.\nWhen displacement occurs, structural integrity becomes questionable and utility\nconnections may be damaged, increasing the risk of fire and electric shock.\nIn multiple-unit dwellings, there is often a main utility shutoff for the entire building, as\nwell as a shutoff located within each individual unit. Depending on the situation at hand,\nyou may need to use one or both. Be mindful of the effects and consequences of using\neach (Unit 6 will cover utility control in more depth).\nMultiple-Use Buildings\nMultiple-use buildings with oversized roof spans have a greater risk of collapse and\nbroken glass in a disaster. These include:\n• Airports;\n• Malls and strip malls;\n• Places of worship;\n• Sports arenas; and\n• Warehouse-type structures.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-8"

The agency has conducted national household\nsurveys to assess the public’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on preparing for a\nrange of hazards since 2007. The 2015 National Household Survey included key\nfindings on individual preparedness, and in general, the preparedness concepts relayed\nthroughout the CERT Basic Training.\n• 68 percent of respondents reported having enough supplies to get through three\ndays.\n• 63 percent of respondents reported having taken steps to safeguard critical\ndocuments.\n• 39 percent of respondents reported having sought preparedness information\nwithin the past year.\n• 27 percent of respondents reported having talked to others about getting\nprepared within the past year.\n• 18 percent of respondents reported having attended a preparedness\nmeeting/training within the past year.\nPreparing for a Disaster\nMany preparedness actions are useful in any type of emergency, and some are specific\nto the type of disaster. A critical first step to preparedness is to understand the hazard\nor hazards that are most relevant to your community. Next, it is important to learn about\nlocal alerts and warning systems, evacuation routes, and sheltering plans. It is also\nimportant to familiarize yourself with hazards in other areas given that you may\nexperience a different and less familiar type of hazard when you are traveling.\nRegardless of the type of disaster, important elements of disaster preparedness\ninclude:\n• Having the skills to evaluate the situation quickly and to take effective action to\nprotect yourself;\n• Having a family disaster plan and practicing the plan with drills;\n• Assembling supplies in multiple locations;\n• Reducing the impact of hazards through mitigation practices; and\n• Getting involved by participating in training and volunteer programs.\nIt is always important to address specific needs, including any access or functional\nneeds, considerations for pets and service animals, and transportation requirements for\nyou and your family and friends.

To make the most\ninformed decision regarding your family’s safety, you should first consider what option\nis best given the situation. It is also essential to practice your plan with your family—\nsuch as evacuating the home and contacting all family members using your “check-in\ncontact.” Practicing your plan now will improve your performance when it matters most.\nCreating a Family Disaster Plan\nTo get started…\n• Contact your local emergency management office and your local chapter of the\nAmerican Red Cross.\nFind out which disasters are most likely to happen in your community.\n-\nAsk how you would receive warnings about the event.\n-\nFind out how to prepare for each type of disaster.\n-\n• Meet with your family.\nDiscuss the types of disasters that could occur.\n-\nExplain how to prepare and respond.\n-\nDiscuss what to do if advised to evacuate.\n-\nPractice what you have discussed.\n-\n• Plan how your family will stay in contact if separated by a disaster.\nPick two meeting places: 1) a location a safe distance from your home in\n-\ncase of fire and 2) a place outside your neighborhood in case you cannot\nreturn home.\nChoose an out-of-state friend as a “check-in contact” for everyone to call.\n-\n• Make sure the person selected understands that they are your out-\nof-state contact in case of emergency and what you would expect\nof them should such an emergency arise.\n• Give your “check-in contact” person a list of pertinent people to\ncontact. Be sure to include phone numbers!\n• Periodically practice using your local and out-of-state contacts as if\nit were an emergency.\nPrepare a business-card size list of family and friends’ phone numbers\n-\nand print one for each family member.\n• FEMA developed the Family Communications Plan to consolidate\nimportant contact information for emergencies. The two-page plan\nincludes double-sided card printouts you can use for this purpose.\n• As a security measure, do not specify relationships.\n• Complete the following steps:\nPost emergency telephone numbers by every home phone and save in\n-\nevery cell phone.\nShow responsible family members how and when to shut off water, gas,\n-\nand electricity at main switches.\nInstall a smoke alarm on each level of your home, especially near\n-\nbedrooms, and a carbon monoxide alarm in or near every bedroom.

One way to prepare is to\nassemble disaster supplies in multiple locations. After disaster strikes, you may not\nhave time to shop or search for supplies. If you have gathered supplies in advance, you\nand your family can endure an evacuation or home confinement.\nTo Prepare Your Disaster Supply Kit\n1. Review the checklists on the next few pages.\n2. Gather the supplies from the list. Remember that many of the items needed for\nyour kits are already in your household. It is possible to assemble these items in\nappropriate locations for quick access in an emergency but use under normal\ncircumstances whenever needed. For example, keep a wrench in your kit to shut\noff gas at the meter in an emergency, but also use the wrench for everyday\ntasks. Just be sure to return it to the emergency kit.\n3. Place the supplies you are likely to need for an evacuation in an easy-to-carry\ncontainer. These supplies are listed with an asterisk (*).\nNotes Regarding Your Disaster Supply Kit:\nWater\n• Store water in plastic containers such as soft drink bottles.\n• Look for the triangular recycling symbol with a number 1 on the bottom of the\nbottle, as those are best for water storage. Avoid using containers that will\ndegrade quickly or break, such as milk jugs or glass bottles.\n• Wash the bottle with soap and warm water, fill with water from your tap, and\nstore in a cool, dark area away from direct sunlight.\n• Replace your emergency water every six months by repeating the process as all\nplastic degrades over time.\n• Keep in mind that a normally active person needs to drink at least 2 quarts of\nwater each day. Hot environments and intense physical activity can double that\nrequirement. Children, nursing mothers, and ill people will need more.\n• Store at least 1 gallon of water per person, per day (3 quarts for drinking, 1 quart\nfor food preparation and sanitation).*\nAugust 2019 Page 1-13"

If you\nare not in immediate danger, you should stay where you are and get more\ninformation before taking your next steps. Thinking through the likely hazards in\nyour community and where you might be when an event occurs may help you\nvisualize your response. Additionally, consider your own circumstances and\nthose of your household.

While you may need to make the first immediate\ndecision to stay inside or go outside or to shelter in place by sealing a room\nwithout authoritative instruction, it is important to listen to local authorities when\nthey provide that information. If experts or local officials tell you to evacuate from\nyour location, LEAVE!\n• Seek clean air and protect breathing passages. Regardless of the type of\ndisaster, clean air is a critical need. Actions to protect your breathing passages\nand to seek clean air may include covering your mouth with a cloth or mask,\nvacating the building, or sheltering in place by sealing an internal room while the\nairborne contaminant dissipates.\n• Protect yourself from debris and signal rescuers if trapped. Protecting\nyourself from falling or precarious debris is an essential protective action. If\ntrapped, protect your airways, bang on an object, or blow a whistle. Yelling\nshould be a last resort.\n• Remove contaminants. If contaminants are released into the area or you\nencounter liquid or solid contaminants, quickly remove contaminated clothing\nbefore washing yourself with soap and water, starting at the head and working\ntoward the feet.\n• Practice good hygiene. Good hygiene is a preventive measure for spreading\ndisease, and it is important to be mindful of hygiene in a post disaster\nenvironment. Clean drinking water and sanitation are important protective\nactions.\nSheltering\nThere are different types of sheltering, and each are appropriate for different disasters.\n• Shelter in place: Sealing a room is a way to protect yourself from contaminants\nin the air for a short period until the contaminants dissipate. You should identify\nan internal room in your home, at work, or other locations where you spend a\ngreat deal of time. If you are required to shelter in place, you will be in this room\nfor only a few hours, but it is important that you be able to seal the room quickly.\nStoring specific items in the room is helpful. You should have snacks and water,\na battery-operated radio, a flashlight, and pre-cut plastic sheeting and duct tape\nto seal off vents and door and window openings.\n• Shelter for extended stay: Sheltering for an extended stay means you would\nstay where you are for several days or, in the case of a pandemic, authorities\nAugust 2019 Page 1-19"

Mitigation is another approach you\ncan take. Mitigation is the reduction of loss of life and property by lessening the impact\nof disasters. Mitigation includes any activities that prevent an emergency, reduce the\nlikelihood of occurrence, or reduce the damaging effects of unavoidable hazards. A few\nexamples include purchasing appropriate insurance and taking structural and\nnonstructural measures.\nYou should ensure your homeowner’s policy provide adequate coverage and covers\nappropriate hazards for your area. Homeowner’s insurance does not cover damage\ncaused by flooding, so it is important to know whether you are in a flood hazard zone. If\nyou are, it is strongly advised to purchase flood insurance. Visit the National Flood\nInsurance Program website, www.Floodsmart.gov, to learn more.\nSome mitigation measures require a bigger investment to address structural changes to\nreduce the impact of disasters (see Table 1.5). Other non-structural mitigation\nmeasures may include relatively simple actions you can take to prevent home\nfurnishings and appliances from causing damage or injuries during any event that might\ncause them to shift.\nTable 5.5: Home Mitigation Measures\nType of Hazard Sample Precautions\n• Bolt older houses to the foundation\n• Install trusses or hurricane straps to reinforce the roof\n• Strap propane tanks and chimneys\nStructural • Strap mobile homes to their concrete pads\n• Raise utilities (above the level of flood risk)\n• Ask a professional to check the foundation, roof connectors,\nchimney, etc.\n• Anchor furniture (e.g., bookshelves, hutches, grandfather\nclocks) to the wall\n• Secure appliances and office equipment in place with\nindustrial strength hook and loop fasteners\n• Secure cabinet doors with childproof fasteners\nNon-Structural • Locate and label shutoffs for gas, electricity, and water\nbefore disasters occur.

CERTs assist\nemergency response personnel when requested in accordance with standard operating\nprocedures developed by the sponsoring agency. Working as a team, members assume\nsome of the same functions as emergency response personnel. As a reminder, while\nCERTs are a valuable asset in emergency response. CERTs are not trained to perform\nall of the functions or respond to the same degree as professional responders. CERTs\nare a bridge to professional responders until they arrive. CERTs respond after a\ndisaster by:\n• Treating life-threatening injuries until professional assistance is available;\n• Helping disaster survivors cope with their emotional stressors;\n• Locating and turning off utilities, if safe to do so;\n• Extinguishing small fires; and\n• Conducting light search and rescue operations.\nThere is a distinction between how a CERT volunteer responds to a disaster as an\nindividual and how that volunteer responds as part of a team. In all instances, it is\ncritical for CERT volunteers to stay within the limits of their training when providing\ndisaster relief.\nA CERT volunteer’s first responsibility is personal and family safety. Only after CERT\nvolunteers have secured their personal and family safety is it possible and pertinent to\nrespond in a group capacity to do what is necessary for the community as a whole.\nThe sponsoring agency orchestrates its group response. In general, the team members\nselect a leader (and alternate) and define the meeting location—or staging area—they\nwill use in the event of disaster.\nCERT volunteers gather at the pre-established staging area to organize and receive\ntasking assignments. Leaders may identify “runners” to serve as a communication link\nbetween the staging area and CERT volunteers working in the field.\nIn some cases, CERT volunteers also provide a well-trained workforce for such duties\nthat entail shelter support, crowd and traffic management, and evacuation. It is\nimportant to note that when you become a CERT volunteer, you do not give up any\nrights you have as United States citizen. You can take the same legally permissible\nactions you would as an individual, but certain restrictions apply when acting as a CERT\nvolunteer. When you put on the green CERT vest, you represent the agency or group\nthat sponsored you.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-23"

CERT\nvolunteers are required to wear the following:\n• Helmet;\n• Goggles;\n• N95 Mask;\n• Gloves (work and non-latex exam); and\n• Sturdy shoes or boots.\nCERT in Action\nAcross the country, CERTs continue to be activated in a wide range of disaster and\nemergency support operations. For these efforts, CERT volunteers and teams are\nreceiving federal, state, and local recognition for their response assistance. For brief\nprofiles on how CERTs have assisted in actual emergencies all over the country visit\nthe national CERT website, www.ready.gov/community-emergencyresponse-team.\nCERTs in Non-Disaster Roles\nCERT volunteers are also a potential volunteer pool for the community. They can help\nwith non-emergency projects such as:\n• Identifying and aiding neighbors and coworkers who might need assistance\nduring an emergency or disaster;\n• Distributing preparedness materials and conducting preparedness\ndemonstrations;\n• Staffing first aid booths and preparedness displays at health fairs, county fairs,\nand other special events;\n• Assisting with the installation of smoke alarms for seniors and special needs\nhouseholds; and\n• Assisting with traffic and crowd management at large community events.\nBy participating in non-emergency community projects, CERT volunteers build\nrecognition for the CERT program within their community and raise overall awareness\nof community preparedness. These events also provide CERT volunteers with valuable\npractice using the Incident Command System and operating with a partner.\nProtection for Disaster Workers\n“Good Samaritan” laws generally protect CERT volunteers who provide care in a\nprudent and reasonable manner.\nThe Volunteer Protection Act (VPA) of 1997 is a Federal law that protects volunteers\nfrom liability as long as they are acting in accordance with the training that they have\nreceived. VPA protects CERT volunteers during a disaster, and volunteers may also\nhave further protection under relevant state statutes where they reside.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-25"

      "text": "CERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: CERT ORGANIZATION\nPrinciples of On-scene Management\nCERT organization is based on the Incident Command System (ICS), which is a proven\nmanagement system used by emergency responders. On-Scene management in a\ndisaster situation follows these principles:\n• Maintain the safety of disaster workers. The CERT Team Leader (TL) must\ncontinually prioritize response activities based on the team’s capability and\ntraining. TLs also maintain the principle that rescuer safety is the number one\nconcern. CERT functional leadership assigns activities and accounts for team\nvolunteers. CERT volunteers work in the buddy system and respond based on\ntheir size-up of the situations that they encounter.\n• Provide clear leadership and organizational structure by developing a chain of\ncommand and roles that are known by all team volunteers. Each CERT member\nhas only one person that he or she takes direction from and responds to.\n• Improve the effectiveness of rescue efforts. Disaster information is collected, and\nresponses are prioritized based on rescuer safety and doing the greatest good\nfor the greatest number according to the team’s capabilities and training.\nCERT Application of On-Scene Management\nThe specific CERT organizational structure and protocols provide:\n• A well-defined management structure (e.g., leadership, functional areas,\nreporting chain, working in teams);\n• A manageable span of control that provides for a desirable rescuer-to-supervisor\nratio, optimum 5-to-1 with an acceptable spread of 2-to-7;\n• Common terminology that contributes to effective communication and shared\nunderstanding;\n• Effective communication among team volunteers and with professional\nresponders, including the use of radios;\n• Consolidated action plans that coordinate strategic goals, tactical objectives, and\nsupport activities;\n• Comprehensive resource management that facilitates application of available\nresources to the incident in a timely manner; and\n• Accountability.\nObjectives for CERT On-Scene Management\nIn a disaster situation, the CERT TL:\n• Identifies the scope of the incident (e.g., What is the problem?);\n• Determines an overall strategy (e.g., What can we do, and how will we do it?);\n• Deploys teams and resources (e.g., Who is going to do what?); and\n• Documents actions and results.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-2"

      "text": "CERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nThe Need for Flexibility\nDisasters create a dynamic, ever-changing environment. The CERT organizational\nframework is flexible so that it can expand or contract depending on the ongoing\nassessment priorities determined by the CERT Team Leader, people, and resources\navailable. This expansion and contraction help ensure:\n• Rescuer safety;\n• Doing the greatest good for the greatest number;\n• A manageable span of control; and\n• Accountability of CERT volunteers.\nIncident Command System\nThe ICS is the system used by emergency response agencies to manage emergency\noperations. When a CERT activates, it becomes part of that system. This section will\nexplain the ICS format and detail how CERTs both operate within the ICS and organize\nthemselves to replicate that of the ICS structure.\nBasic ICS structure for a CERT is established by the person who arrives first on the\nscene. This person becomes the TL. Initially, the TL may handle all of the command\npositions of the ICS but, as the incident evolves, he or she may assign personnel as\nneeded to the ICS Command Functions:\n• Operations Section Chief;\n• Intelligence/Investigations Section Chief;\n• Planning Section Chief;\n• Logistics Section Chief; and\n• Finance/Administration Section Chief.\nThrough an effective ICS, all CERT volunteers report through a chain of command to\nthe TL. The TL reports to the first fire or law enforcement official at their location and\ntakes direction from that person until otherwise directed or until the CERT is relieved.\nImage 2.1: ICS Command Function Organization Chart\nAugust 2019 Page 2-3"

CERTs will typically require the Operations,\nPlanning, and Logistics functions. The CERT Team Leader is responsible for handling\nor delegating each function to team volunteers.\nAs the incident expands, CERT volunteers are assigned or re-assigned to each section\nto handle specific aspects of the response while maintaining an effective span of\ncontrol.\n• CERT Team Leader:\n― Ensures incident safety;\n― Establishes incident objectives;\n― Delegates authority to others;\n― Provides information to internal and external parties;\n― Establishes and maintains liaison with other responders (e.g., fire, law\nenforcement, public works, other CERTs); and\n― Takes direction from agency officials.\n• Intelligence/Investigations Section:\n― Prevents and deters potential unlawful activity, incidents, and/or attacks;\n― Collects, processes, analyzes, secures, and appropriately disseminates\ninformation and intelligence;\n― Conducts investigations; and\n― Informs and supports life safety operations.\nIntelligence/Investigations is a function in the formal Incident Command System;\nhowever, CERTs will have a very limited involvement, if any, with this function.\n• Planning Section:\n― Tracks resource status (e. g., number of CERT volunteers who have\n“reported for duty”);\n― Tracks situation status;\n― Prepares the Team’s action plan;\n― Develops alternative strategies; and\n― Provides documentation services.\n• Logistics Section:\n― Provides communications;\n― Provides food and medical support to Team volunteers;\n― Manages supplies and facilities; and\n― Make sure that there are adequate resources (e.g., personnel, supplies,\nand equipment) for meeting the incident objectives.\n• Finance and Administration Section:\n― Conducts contract negotiation and monitoring;\n― Keeps track of timekeeping;\n― Provides cost analysis; and\n― Tracks compensation for injury or damage to property.\nFinance and Administration is a function in the formal Incident Command System;\nhowever, CERTs will have very limited involvement, if any, with this function.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-4"

During activation for a disaster, the first\nperson at a pre-designated staging area assumes this responsibility. The initial\nTL may hand off this role to a pre-designated leader when that person arrives.\n• The location established by the CERT TL as the central point for command and\ncontrol of the incident is called the Command Post for the CERT. The TL stays in\nthe Command Post. If the TL has to leave, the responsibility of TL must be\ndelegated to someone in the Command Post.\nUsing the ICS structure, CERT volunteers are assigned to assist with a range of\nfunctions including:\n• Logistics—managing resources, services, and supplies;\n• Planning/Intelligence—collecting and displaying information; collecting and\ncompiling documentation; and\n• Operations—conducting fire suppression, medical operations, search and\nrescue.\nIn all situations, each unit assigned must have an identified leader to supervise tasks\nbeing performed, to account for team volunteers, and to report information to his or her\ndesignated leader.\nIn all situations, a manageable span of control is five rescuers per supervisor, with an\nacceptable spread of two to seven.\nCERT personnel assigned to Operations should always be assigned to teams\nconsisting of between one and five people:\n• One person will serve as runner and communicate with the Command Post.\n• Two people will “buddy up” to respond to the immediate needs.\n• Search and rescue teams must include at least four people, with a safety team\nremaining outside the area subject to search, and at least two people to conduct\nthe search.\nImage 2.2: Expanded CERT Operations Structure\nCERT operations section structure, showing the Operations Section Chief at the top and the three\nGroup.

The TL should then\nrefer the media inquiries to the Public Information Officer of the CERT’s sponsoring\norganization.\nIf the Public Information Officer of the sponsoring organization refers media to the\nCERT TL or otherwise authorizes them to speak with the media, the TL should:\n• Refrain from addressing the media until doing so will no longer inhibit or delay\nthe team’s ability to do the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest\namount of time;\n• Establish an area for briefing the media if necessary;\n• Be careful about the information he or she releases, making sure it is both\naccurate and approved for release, while also keeping in mind victims’ right to\nprivacy; and\n• Not feel compelled to answer every question asked.\nNational Incident Management System Implementation\nThe ICS is part of the National Incident Management System (NIMS).

It applies at all\njurisdictional levels and across all emergency management functions and types of\nincidents.\nNIMS was established so that first responders, including CERT volunteers, from\ndifferent jurisdictions and disciplines can work together better to respond to disasters\nand emergencies.\n• To meet NIMS standards, CERT volunteers must complete both the IS-100\n(Introduction to Incident Command System) and IS-700 (Introduction to National\nIncident Management System [NIMS]) courses.\n• Both independent study courses are available online from FEMA at\nhttp://training.fema.gov/IS/NIMS.asp.\nExercise 2.1: ICS Functions\nPurpose: This activity will give you an opportunity to relate the ICS functions to specific\nsituations.\nInstructions:\n1. Break into small table groups.\n2. This exercise provides you with the opportunity to decide under which ICS\nfunctions the listed activities will fall.\n3. Review the list of activities and use the initials, “TL,” “O,” “P,” or “L” to indicate\nwhich ICS function would cover each activity.\nWhile Finance and Administration is a part of ICS, it is generally not used by CERTs.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-6"

As other CERT volunteers arrive, the CERT TL may pass leadership\nto someone else. The CERT TL establishes operations to ensure effective\ncommunication, to maintain span of control, maintain accountability, and help the\ngreatest number without placing CERT volunteers in harm’s way.\n• One of the CERT TL’s first decisions will be to locate the team’s Command Post.\nThe staging area may become the Command Post; however, if another location\nwould be safer or otherwise better, the Command Post should be set up there.\n• As intelligence is collected and assessed, the TL must prioritize actions and work\nwith the Section Chiefs or leaders. The CERT organization is flexible and evolves\nbased on new information.\nFollowing an incident, information—and, therefore, priorities—may be change rapidly.\nCommunication between the CERT TL and response teams ensures that CERTs do not\noverextend their resources or supplies.\nCERT On-Scene Size-up\nOn-Scene Size-up should be conducted upon CERT mobilization. Size-up is a continual\nprocess that enables professional responders to make decisions and respond\nappropriately in the areas of greatest need. CERT size-up consists of 9 steps and\nshould be used in any emergency situation.\nRefer the participants to CERT On-Scene Size-up in the Participant Manual. Although\nthe checklist is not exhaustive, it does include many of the questions that CERT\nvolunteers should ask when sizing up an emergency situation.\nCERT Size-up Steps\nThe 9 steps of CERT size-up are:\n1. Gather facts. What has happened? How many people appear to be involved?\nWhat is the current situation?\n2. Assess and communicate the damage. Try to determine what has happened,\nwhat is happening now, and how bad things can really get.\n3. Consider probabilities. What is likely to happen? What could happen through\ncascading events?\n4. Assess your own situation. Are you in immediate danger? Have you been\ntrained to handle the situation? Do you have the equipment that you need?\n5. Establish priorities. Are lives at risk? Can you help? Remember, life safety is\nthe first priority!\nAugust 2019 Page 2-8"

      "text": "CERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 3 OVERVIEW\nUnderstanding the medical operations environment in a disaster is crucial to CERT’s\nsuccess in assisting emergency responders. Units 3 and 4, Disaster Medical Operations\nPart I and II, teach life-saving steps CERT volunteers can take immediately following\ntrauma. It also provides an overview of how emergency responders apply and organize\ndisaster medical care in the event of a large-scale disaster. CERT volunteer’s\nassistance with disaster medical operations can play a vital role in limiting deaths from\ntrauma.\nUnits 3 and 4 do not provide an absolute way of how to manage disaster medical\noperations. Many localities will handle disaster medical operations differently, and there\nis not one concrete way to teach this material. Instead, the goal of Units 3 and 4 is to\nprovide a high-level overview about the immediate medical interventions CERT\nvolunteers can take to save lives, including how disaster medical operations may\noperate.\nIn a disaster, there may be more survivors than rescuers, and assistance from medical\nprofessionals may not be immediately available. While emergency medical responders\nare quick to arrive, any delay between injury and the initiation of care can result in\ndeath. Those nearest to someone with life-threatening injuries are in the best position to\nprovide the first care, which should focus on the most essential actions. These essential\nactions include moving someone away from ongoing danger, stopping life-threatening\nbleeding, positioning the injured so they can breathe, keeping them warm, and providing\ncomfort.\nCERT volunteers are trained to be part of disaster medical operations and to assist in\nproviding treatment for life-threatening conditions. Remember, the mission of CERT is\nto provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In a disaster with many\nsurvivors, time will be critical. CERT volunteers must work quickly and efficiently to help\nas many survivors as possible.\nAll CERT participants are encouraged to take basic first aid and CPR training; however,\neven if you have taken first aid courses you will need to understand CERT covers basic\nmedical interventions for life-threatening (traumatic) injuries. This course does not teach\nCPR. To find a CPR course near you, search your local chapters of the American Red\nCross and American Heart Association.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Identify life-threatening conditions resulting from trauma including severe\nbleeding, low body temperature, and airway blockage;\n2. Apply correct life saving techniques; and\n3. Provide basic first-aid care for non-life-threatening injuries.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-1"

CERT volunteers should use their best judgement to\ndetermine if the situation is safe enough to help a survivor.\nSome questions CERT volunteers can consider are:\n• Do I feel safe at this spot?\n• Should I leave a move to a safer location, or am I able to stay and start providing\ncare immediately?\n• If I leave, can I take anyone with me?\nWhatever the decision is, the goal is to get help to the people who need it as soon as\npossible.\nApproaching the Patient\nWhen able, CERT volunteers should first ensure they are wearing the appropriate and\nproper personal protective equipment (PPE). For a detailed list of PPE, please\nreference Unit 1.\nThere are several steps to take when approaching a patient.\nStep 1: If the patient is conscious, be sure he or she can see you.\nStep 2: Identify yourself by giving your name and indicating the organization with which\nyou are affiliated.\nStep 3: Always request permission to treat an individual. If the individual is\nunconscious, it is assumed that the patient has given “implied consent,” and you may\ntreat him or her. Ask a parent or guardian for permission to treat a child, if possible.\nStep 4: Whenever possible, respect cultural differences.\nStep 5: Remember, all medical patients are legally entitled to confidentiality (HIPAA).\nWhen dealing with patients, always be mindful and respectful of the privacy of their\nmedical condition.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-2"

Severe blood loss can result\nin irreversible shock. This means that if you lose about half of your body’s blood supply,\nno matter what anyone does to try to save you, death is unavoidable. You must get\nbleeding under control as soon as possible.\nIndications of life-threatening bleeding include:\n• Spurting/steady bleeding;\n• Blood is pooling;\n• Blood is soaking through overlying clothes;\n• Blood is soaking through bandages; and\n• Amputation.\nLife-threatening decreases in blood pressure often are associated with a state of shock.\nThere are typically four stages of excessive bleeding.\nStage 1: Loss of <15% of blood volume. Patient appears normal with a slightly\nincreased heart rate.\nStage 2: Loss of 15%-30% of blood volume. Patient’s body is able to compensate for\nthe loss of blood but may appear agitated or anxious as vital signs rise.\nStage 3: Loss of 30%-40% of blood volume. Patient becomes unable to compensate\nand condition worsens. If left untreated will proceed to irreversible shock. Patient\nappears confused.\nStage 4: Loss of >40% of blood volume. Patient enters irreversible shock. Patient\nappears lethargic and death will occur within minutes because of overwhelming and\nirreversible damage to vital organs.\nTable 3.1: Stages of Severe Bleeding\nHeart Rate Blood Breath Patient\nStage Blood Loss\nPressure Rate\nLess than Normal (<100 bpm) Normal 14-20 Patient appears\nI\n15% normal\nFast (>100 bpm) Slightly Low 20-30 Patient may feel\nII 15%-40%\nanxious\nVery Fast Low 30-40 Patient feels\nIII 30%-40%\n(>120 bpm) confused\nGreater Critical (>140 bpm) Critical >35 Patient feels\nIV\nthan 40% lethargic\nTypes of bleeding are characterized by the speed of the blood flow.\nArterial bleeding: Arteries transport blood under high pressure. Blood coming from an\nartery will spurt.\nVenous bleeding: Veins transport blood under low pressure. Blood coming from a vein\nwill flow.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-3"

Blood coming from\ncapillaries will ooze.\nDirect Pressure\nThe first way to try to control excessive bleeding is through applying direct pressure. To\ncontrol and stop bleeding through direct pressure, follow the steps below.\nStep 1: Find the source(s) of bleeding.\nStep 2: If you have something to put in between the blood and your hands, use it. (e.g.,\ngloves, a cloth, a plastic bag.)\nStep 3: Apply firm, steady pressure directly on the source of the bleeding. Push hard to\nstop or slow bleeding—even if it is painful to the injured!\nStep 4: Keep pressure applied until EMS takes over care or bleeding has stopped. If\nyou are unsure if bleeding has stopped, continue applying pressure and wait for EMS.\nSome things to keep in mind when applying direct pressure:\n• Try to provide a barrier against the blood, if possible. Gloves are best.\n• Do not use the same gloves or barrier on more than one person.\n• If your barrier becomes blood soaked, replace it, but do not layer more things on\ntop of it.\n• Do not place bulky layers in between your hands and the source of the wound\nbecause it decreases the effectiveness of the pressure.\n• Correctly applied pressure may not be comfortable for the injured. Do not let up;\nhold pressure until EMS arrives.\nTourniquets\nIf you cannot stop the bleeding by applying direct pressure and EMS professionals are\ndelayed in responding, a tourniquet may be a viable option to save a person from\nbleeding to death. Tourniquets have been used effectively in combat to control bleeding\nin a wounded soldier’s extremities (arms or legs) and are increasingly being used by\nuniformed responders in civilian emergencies. Tourniquets are safe and effective when\napplied appropriately; you are more likely to save a life than cause the loss of a limb if\nyou use a tourniquet.\nA tourniquet is a tight bandage, which when placed around a limb and tightened, cuts\noff the blood supply to the part of the limb beyond it.\nIf a commercial tourniquet is not readily available, you can try to create one yourself\nusing something that is broad, flexible, strong, and able to be twisted, tightened, and\nsecured, such as a webbed belt or luggage strap or material. Improvised tourniquets\noften fail, but you can attempt to use them as a last resort to at least slow the bleeding.\nHow to use a tourniquet:\nStep 1: Place as high as possible on the injured limb – closest to the torso. (You can\nplace it over clothing.)\nStep 2: Pull the strap through the buckle.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-4"

It is possible — and, in fact, common —\nfor an individual suffering from shock to be fully coherent and not complaining of pain.\nPay attention to subtle clues, as failure to recognize shock will have serious\nconsequences.\nMain signs of shock:\n• Rapid and shallow breathing;\n• Capillary refill of greater than two seconds; and\n• Failure to follow simple commands, such as “squeeze my hand.”\nWhen a patient is in shock, avoid rough or excessive handling. It is also important to\nmaintain the patient’s body temperature.\nMaintaining Body Temperature\nIf necessary, place a blanket or other material under and/or over the patient to provide\nprotection from extreme ground temperatures (hot or cold). People with very serious\ninjuries are more susceptible to hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature.\nHypothermia increases the risk of death in survivors with serious injuries, so you must\nmaintain normal body temperatures in patients as much as possible.\nTo keep a person warm, you should:\n• Remove wet clothing;\nAugust 2019 Page 3-5"

Swap roles and have the new rescuer complete the above steps.\nOpening the Airway\nPositioning an injured patient to keep their airway open and clear is critical to saving\ntheir life. The best position for the body is one in which the chest can expand fully, and\nthe airway is not at risk of being obstructed. In other words, the best position is one in\nwhich the tongue cannot flop back into the individual’s throat and one in which blood or\nfluid does not end up in the lungs (aspirated), particularly in the case with someone with\nfacial trauma.\nThe respiratory system includes the following components:\n• Lung;\n• Bronchus;\n• Larynx;\n• Pharynx;\n• Nasal Cavity; and\n• Trachea.\nThere are different ways to position an injured patient to keep their airway open\ndepending on if the patient is conscious or unconscious.\nPositioning a Conscious Patient\nSomeone who is awake will naturally assume the position that is best for them given\ntheir injuries.

A few examples of\nburn-related size-up questions to ask are:\n• What caused the burn?\n• Is the danger still present?\n• When did the burning cease?\nThe objectives of first aid treatment for burns are to:\n• Prevent hypothermia;\n• Manage pain; and\n• Reduce the risk of infection.\nHeat, chemicals, electrical current, or radiation may cause burns. The severity of a burn\ndepends on the:\n• Temperature of the burning agent;\n• Period of time the patient was exposed;\n• Area of the body that was affected;\n• Size of the area burned; and\n• Depth of the burn.\nBurn Classifications\nDepending on the severity, burns may affect all three layers of skin.\n1. The epidermis, or outer layer of skin, contains nerve endings and is penetrated\nby hairs.\n2. The dermis, or middle layer of skin, contains blood vessels, oil glands, hair\nfollicles, and sweat glands.\n3.

Put out any flames and remove\nsmoldering clothing unless it is stuck to the skin.\n• Cool skin or clothing, if they are still hot, by immersing them in cool water for not\nmore than one minute or covering with clean compresses that have been soaked\nin cool water and wrung out. *Note that rapid temperature changes can cause\nshock in the patient, so it is important to assess the size and severity of the burn\nprior to attempting to cool the skin to prevent a drop-in body temperature.\n• Cooling sources include water from the bathroom or kitchen; garden hose; and\nsoaked towels, sheets, or other cloths.\n• Do not use ice. Ice causes vessel constriction.\nDress the burn:\n• Cover loosely with dry, sterile dressings to keep air out, reduce pain, and prevent\ninfection.\n• Wrap fingers and toes loosely and individually when treating severe burns to the\nhands and feet.\n• Loosen clothing near the affected area. Remove jewelry if necessary, taking care\nto document what you removed, when, and to whom you gave it.\n• Do not apply antiseptics, ointments, or other remedies.\n• Do not remove shreds of tissue, break blisters, or remove adhered particles of\nclothing (cut burned-in clothing around the burn.)\nGuidelines for Treating Chemical Burns\nUnlike more traditional burns, chemical burns do not result from extreme heat, and\ntherefore, treatment differs greatly (e.g., decontamination procedures). If you suspect a\nchemical burn, it is best to defer treatment to trained medical professionals.\nChemical burns are not always obvious. Consider chemical burns as a possibility if the\npatient’s skin is burning and there is no sign of a fire. If you suspect a chemical burn:\n• Protect yourself from contact with the substance. Use your protective gear,\nespecially goggles, mask, and gloves;\n• Be sure to remove any affected clothing or jewelry;\n• If the irritant is dry, gently brush away as much as possible. Always brush away\nfrom the eyes and away from the patient and yourself;\n• Use lots of cool running water to flush the chemical from the skin for at least 10\nminutes. The running water will dilute the chemical fast enough to prevent the\ninjury from getting worse;\nAugust 2019 Page 3-10"

The focus of this\nsection is on bandaging, which will help to prevent secondary infection.\nBandaging Wounds\nOnce you have controlled bleeding, you will need to apply a dressing and bandage to\nhelp maintain the clot and prevent infection.\nThere is a difference between a dressing and a bandage:\n• Apply dressing directly to the wound. Whenever possible, a dressing should be\nsterile; and\n• A bandage holds the dressing in place.\nIf a wound is still bleeding, the bandage should place enough pressure on the wound to\nhelp control bleeding without interfering with circulation.\nRules of Dressing\nThe rules of dressing are:\n• If there is active bleeding (i.e., if the dressing is soaked with blood), redress over\nthe existing dressing and maintain pressure to control bleeding; and\n• In the absence of active bleeding, maintain the pressure and keep the wound\nbandaged until further treatment by a medical professional.\nSigns of possible infection include:\n• Swelling around the wound site;\n• Discoloration;\n• Discharge from the wound; and\n• Red striations from the wound site.\nAmputations\nIf CERT volunteers are assisting a patient with a severed body part there are a few\nguidelines to follow.

This situation is usually outside the\nscope of CERT training. The best course of action is to find trained medical personnel\n(EMS) to care for a patient with an impaled object. However, in the event that EMS is\nstill a long way from the scene or otherwise unavailable, there are a few steps you can\ntake to provide care.\nWhen a foreign object impales a patient, you should:\n• Immobilize the affected body part;\n• Not attempt to move or remove the object, unless it is obstructing the airway;\n• Try to control bleeding at the entrance wound without placing undue pressure on\nthe foreign object;\n• Clean and dress the wound making sure to stabilize the impaled object; and\n• Wrap bulky dressings around the object to keep it from moving.\nTreating Fractures, Dislocations, Sprains, and Strains\nThe objective when treating a suspected fracture, sprain, or strain is to immobilize the\ninjury and the joints immediately above and below the injury site. Because it is difficult to\ndistinguish among fractures, sprains, or strains, if uncertain of the type of injury, CERT\nmembers should treat the injury as a fracture.\nFractures\nA fracture is a complete break, a chip, or a crack in a bone. There are several types of\nfractures.\n• An open fracture is a broken bone with some kind of wound that allows\ncontaminants to enter into or around the fracture site.\n• A closed fracture is a broken bone with no associated wound.

You should treat a suspected fracture as a fracture until professional treatment\nis available.\nImage 3.4: Displaced and Nondisplaced Fractures\nTreating an Open Fracture\nClosed fractures are generally treated with splinting, but open fractures are more\ndangerous because they pose a significant risk of severe bleeding and infection.\nTherefore, they are a higher priority and volunteers should check them more frequently.\nWhen treating an open fracture:\n• Do not draw the exposed bone ends back into the tissue; and\n• Do not irrigate the wound.\nYou should:\n• Cover the wound with a sterile dressing and apply pressure;\n• Splint the fracture without disturbing the wound; and\n• Place a moist 4 by 4-inch dressing over the bone end to keep it from drying out.\nDislocations\nDislocations are another common injury in emergencies. A dislocation is an injury to the\nligaments around a joint that is so severe that it permits a separation of the bone from\nits normal position in a joint.\nThe signs of a dislocation are similar to those of a closed fracture, and you should treat\na suspected dislocation like a closed fracture.\nYou should not try to relocate a suspected dislocation.

Typically, stretching or\nextending the joint beyond its normal limits causes the sprain.\nA sprain is considered a partial dislocation, although the bone either remains in place or\nis able to fall back into place after the injury. Whether an injury is a strain, sprain, or\nclosed fracture, treat the injury as if it is a closed fracture.\nThe most common signs of a sprain are:\n• Tenderness at the site of the injury;\n• Swelling and/or bruising; and\n• Restricted use or loss of use.\nSplinting\nSplinting is the most common procedure for immobilizing an injury.\nCardboard is the most common type of material used for makeshift splints, but a variety\nof materials can be used, including:\n• Soft materials: Towels, blankets, or pillows, tied with bandaging materials or soft\ncloths; and\n• Rigid materials: A board, metal strip, folded magazine or newspaper, or another\nrigid item.\nVolunteers can create anatomical splints by securing a fractured bone to an adjacent\nun-fractured bone.

The combination\nof inadequate circulation and extreme temperatures will cause tissue in these\nextremities to freeze, and in some cases, tissue death will result. Frostbite is most\ncommon in the nose, ears, hands, and feet.\nThere are several key signs and symptoms of frostbite:\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, purple, black);\n• Burning or tingling sensation, at times not localized to the injury site; and\n• Partial or complete numbness.\nWarm a patient suffering from frostbite slowly!

If left\nuntreated, heat exhaustion will develop into heat stroke.\nHeat Stroke\nSome or all of the following symptoms characterize heat stroke:\n• Hot, red skin;\n• Lack of perspiration;\n• Changes in consciousness; and/or\n• Rapid, weak pulse and rapid, shallow breathing.\nIn a heat stroke patient, body temperature can be very high — as high as 105º F. If an\nindividual suffering from heat stroke is not treated, death can result.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-17"

Take the patient out of the heat and place in a cool environment.\n2. Cool the body slowly with cool, wet towels or sheets. If possible, put the patient in\na cool bath.\n3. Have a heat stroke patient drink water, SLOWLY, at the rate of approximately\nhalf a glass of water every 15 minutes. Consuming too much water too quickly\nwill cause nausea and vomiting in a patient of heat sickness.\n4. If the patient is experiencing vomiting, cramping, or is losing consciousness, DO\nNOT administer food or drink. Alert a medical professional as soon as possible\nand keep a close watch on the individual until professional help is available.\nInsect Bites and Stings\nIn a disaster environment, insect bites and stings may be more common than is typical\nas these creatures, like people, are under additional stress.\nThe specific symptoms vary depending on the type of creature, but generally, bites and\nstings can result in redness and itching, tingling or burning at the site of the injury, and\noften a welt on the skin at the site.\nTreatment for insect bites and stings follows the steps below.\nStep 1: Remove the stinger if still present by scraping the edge of a credit card or other\nstiff, straight-edged object across the stinger. Do not use tweezers; these may squeeze\nthe venom sac and increase the amount of venom released.\nStep 2: Wash the site thoroughly with soap and water.\nStep 3: Place ice (wrapped in a washcloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and\nthen off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process.\nAllergic Reactions to Bites and Stings\nThe greatest concern with any insect bite or sting is a severe allergic reaction, or\nanaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs when an allergic reaction becomes so severe that it\ncompromises the airway. If you suspect anaphylaxis:\n• Calm the individual;\n• If possible, find and help administer a patient’s Epi-pen. (Many severe allergy\nsufferers carry one at all times); and\n• DO NOT administer medicine aside from the Epi-pen. This includes pain\nrelievers, allergy medicine, etc.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-18"

While these incidents are infrequent, CERT volunteers can play an\nimportant role by supporting local resources in responding to the incident.\nExamples of mass casualty incidents include:\n• Commuter train derailment;\n• Multi-car accident;\n• Bus accident;\n• Building collapse; and\n• Natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes).\nIn mass casualty incidents, first responder personnel:\n• Establish command and control of the incident area;\n• Conduct a scene size-up and set-up;\n• Send survivors with relatively minor injuries to a holding area to await treatment;\n• Identify survivors who require life-saving interventions and treat them\nimmediately;\n• Identify deceased victims as well as survivors too severely injured to save;\n• Manage medical transportation for survivors who require additional treatment;\n• Secure the area to protect first responders, survivors, and evidence for law\nenforcement investigations; and\n• Remove debris and other safety or health threats.\nIn addition to providing critical life-saving interventions, first responders must organize a\nlikely chaotic situation when they arrive on scene. To support first responders, CERT\nvolunteers must understand their role during mass casualty incidents.\nRole of CERT Volunteers during Mass Casualty Incidents\nWhether dispatched to the scene or located nearby by coincidence, the first task of a\nCERT volunteer is to conduct a scene size-up. Take a moment to look around the\nscene and determine the appropriate course of action.\n• Call 9-1-1 and provide the operator with the information gathered during your\ninitial size-up.\n• Put on your personal protective equipment (PPE), and any CERT affiliated gear,\nsuch as a hat, vest, or shirt.\n• Locate the nearest first responder and identify yourself as a CERT volunteer.\nGive them your local agency affiliation.\n• If a first responder is not available, assess the situation and determine whether\nyou can provide life-saving interventions, such as controlling bleeding or opening\nan airway.\n• Once responders have arrived, provide them with detailed information from your\nsize-up, and ask how you may be of assistance.

      "text": "CERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: ESTABLISHING MEDICAL TREATMENT AREAS\nAs soon as injured survivors are confirmed, first responders will begin to set up one or\nmore treatment area(s). The location of treatment areas will take into consideration\nsafety for rescuers and survivors, as well as, ease of access to resources (e.g., medical\nsupplies, transport areas). First responders may call on CERT volunteers to help\nestablish treatment areas or supply needs.\nDecentralized Treatment Areas: It is sometimes necessary to set up more than one\nmedical treatment location. The severity of the damage, number of injuries and\ncasualties, and the safety of the immediate environment determine where the initial\ntreatment area(s) should be located. Having multiple treatment areas can provide life-\nsaving interventions when a central location is too far away from the initial treatment\narea.\n• A medical treatment location should be set up a safe distance from, but not too\nfar from, each of the damage sites.\n• Each treatment location should include physically separated treatment areas for\nsurvivors and a morgue.\n• Survivors remain under treatment at the location until first responders can\ntransport them to a location for professional medical care.\nCentralized Treatment Areas: In an event with few injured survivors at several sites,\nfirst responders may need to establish one central medical treatment location. A\ncentralized location may need to be set up even when there are decentralized sites\nestablished.\n• The location should include physically separated treatment areas and a morgue.\n• Move survivors to the treatment area from where they were initially rescued,\nassessed, and treated. They should remain under treatment there until first\nresponders can transport them to a location for professional medical treatment.\n• A central medical treatment area facilitates the effective use of resources since a\nlimited number of medical operation personnel in one location can take care of a\ngreater number of survivors.\n• First responders and other medical professionals will generally be able to\ntransport the injured more efficiently from one central location than from multiple\ndecentralized locations.\n• Move the deceased to the morgue, which should be separated from the survivor\ntreatment area, in the centralized treatment area.\nWhether a treatment area is centralized or is one in several decentralized areas, the\nlocation(s) selected should be:\n• Accessible by transportation vehicles (ambulances, trucks, helicopters, etc.); and\n• Expandable.\nSafety for Rescuers and Survivors\nCERT volunteers may play a role in light search and rescue operations.

As a reminder, the severity of the damage, number of injuries and casualties, and\nthe safety of the immediate environment determine where the initial treatment area(s)\nshould be located. In all cases, your individual safety is the number one priority.\n• In structures with light damage, CERT members assess the survivors as they\nfind them. Further medical treatment is performed in a safe location inside the\ndesignated treatment areas.\n• In structures with moderate damage, CERT members assess the survivors as\nthey find them; however, survivors are sent to a medical treatment area a safe\ndistance from the incident.\n• CERT members are not to enter a building with heavy damage under any\ncircumstances.\nCERT volunteers should never declare or attempt to move a patient who has died.

Perform the entire assessment before\ninitiating treatment.\nDo not conduct an assessment if a patient requires immediate care to prevent serious\ninjury or death. In these cases, CERT volunteers should administer the necessary\ntreatment before they follow up with an assessment.\nObjectives of Head-to-Toe Assessments\nThe objectives of a head-to-toe assessment are to:\n• Determine, as clearly as possible, the extent of injuries;\n• Determine what type of treatment the patient needs; and\n• Document injuries.\nRemember to wear your PPE when conducting head-to-toe assessments.\nWhat to Look for in Head-to-Toe Assessments\nThe medical community uses the acronym DCAP-BTLS to remember what to look for\nwhen conducting a rapid assessment. DCAP-BTLS stands for the following:\n• Deformities;\n• Contusions (bruising);\n• Abrasions;\n• Punctures;\n• Burns;\n• Tenderness;\n• Lacerations; and\n• Swelling.\nWhen conducting a head-to-toe assessment, CERT volunteers should look for DCAP-\nBTLS in all parts of the body.\nRemember to provide IMMEDIATE treatment for life-threatening injuries.\nPay careful attention to how people have been hurt (i.e., what caused the harm)\nbecause it provides insight to probable injuries suffered.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-7"

If the patient is conscious, CERT members should always\nask permission to conduct the assessment. The patient has the right to refuse\ntreatment.\nBe sure to talk with the conscious patient to reduce anxiety.\nHead-to-toe assessments should be:\n• Conducted on all survivors, even those who seem all right;\n• Verbal (if the patient is able to speak); and\n• Hands-on. Do not be afraid to remove clothing to look.\nMake sure you conduct each head-to-toe assessment the same way; doing so will make\nthe procedure quicker and more accurate with each assessment. Remember to:\n• Pay careful attention;\n• Look, listen, and feel for anything unusual;\n• Suspect a spinal injury in all unconscious survivors and treat accordingly; and\n• Check your own hands for patient bleeding as you perform the head-to-toe\nassessment.\nCheck (DCAP-BTLS) body parts from the head to toe for fractured bones and soft tissue\ninjuries in the following order:\n1. Head;\n2. Neck;\n3. Shoulders;\n4. Chest;\n5. Arms;\n6. Abdomen;\n7. Pelvis; and\n8. Legs.\nWhile conducting a head-to-toe assessment, CERT volunteers should always check for:\n• Pulse, Movement, Sensation (PMS) in all extremities; and\n• Medical ID emblems on bracelet or necklace.\nClosed-Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries\nWhen conducting head-to-toe assessments, rescuers may find survivors who have or\nmay have suffered closed-head, neck, or spinal injuries.\nA closed-head injury is a concussion-type injury as opposed to a laceration, or tear\nwound, although lacerations can indicate that the survivor has suffered a closed- head\ninjury.\nThe main objective when CERT members encounter suspected injuries to the head or\nspine is to do no harm. You should minimize movement of the head and spine while\ntreating any life-threatening conditions.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-8"

CERT members may need to be\ncreative by:\n• Looking for materials — a door, desktop, building materials — to use as a\nbackboard; and\n• Looking for items — towels, draperies, or clothing — to stabilize the head on the\nboard by tucking them snugly on either side of the head to immobilize it.\nOnly move survivors to increase the safety of the rescuer and survivor or when\nprofessional help will be delayed, and a medical treatment area is established to care\nfor multiple survivors.\n• Moving patients with suspected head, neck, or spinal injury requires sufficient\npatient stabilization.

CERT members and CERT programs should take measures to avoid the\nspread of disease.\nThe primary public health measures include:\n• Maintaining proper hygiene;\n• Maintaining proper sanitation;\n• Purifying water (if necessary); and\n• Preventing the spread of disease.\nMaintaining Hygiene\nThe maintenance of proper personal hygiene is critical even under makeshift conditions.\nSome steps individuals should take to maintain hygiene are listed below.\n• Wash hands frequently using soap and water. Hand washing should be thorough\n(at least 15 to 20 seconds of vigorous rubbing on all surfaces of the hand).\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizers, which do not require water, are a good alternative\nto hand washing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends\nproducts that are at least 60 percent alcohol. To use an alcohol-based hand\nsanitizer, apply about ½ teaspoon of the product to the palm of your hand. Rub\nyour hands together, covering all surfaces, until hands are dry.\n• Wear non-latex exam gloves at all times. Change or disinfect gloves after\nexamining and/or treating each patient. Under field conditions, individuals can\nuse rubber gloves if sterilized between treating survivors using bleach and water\n(one-part bleach to 10 parts water).\n• Keep dressings sterile. Do not remove the wrapping from dressings until use.\nAfter opening, use the entire package of dressing, if possible.\n• Wash any areas using soap and water or diluted bleach that come in contact with\nbody fluids.\nPractice proper hygiene techniques even during exercises.\nMaintaining Sanitation\nPoor sanitation is a major cause of infection. CERT medical operations personnel can\nmaintain sanitary conditions by following some simple steps.\n• Controlling the disposal of bacterial sources (e.g., soiled exam gloves,\ndressings).\n• Putting waste products in plastic bags, tying off the bags, and marking them as\nmedical waste. Keep medical waste separate from other trash and dispose of it\nas hazardous waste.\n• Burying human waste. Select a burial site away from the operations area and\nmark the burial site for later cleanup.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-11"

In responding to both natural disasters and acts of violence, CERT\nvolunteers must be prepared to deal with the psychological effects of the trauma. These\nmay include fear, anger, intense sadness, frustration, and traumatic grief. Survivors and\nCERT volunteers alike are at risk for experiencing these psychological effects.\nCERT volunteers prepare themselves for their role during and following a disaster by\nlearning about the possible emotional and physical impact of disasters on them and\nothers. This knowledge helps CERT volunteers understand and manage their reactions\nto the event while enabling them to work better with others.\nRemember what you have learned about team organization. Team organization\nconcepts can help you both operationally and psychologically. Working together and\nlooking out for each other are important aspects of successful teams.\nPsychological first aid is not therapy; rather, it is a set of techniques to provide\nemotional intervention during field operations. The techniques covered in this unit will\nhelp you manage personal situations, so you can meet the needs of all survivors,\nincluding your fellow CERT volunteers.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n1. Understand disaster trauma for survivors and rescuers, including CERT\nvolunteers.\n2. List steps to take for personal and team well-being.\n3.

Normal\nstress reactions to disaster environments can result from:\n1. Dealing with your own personal losses;\n2. Working in your neighborhood;\n3. Assisting neighbors, friends, or coworkers who have been injured; and\n4. Feeling unsafe and insecure.\n“Vicarious trauma” is a common occupational hazard for disaster response volunteers.\nVicarious trauma—also referred to as compassion fatigue, secondary victimization, or\nsecondary traumatic stress—is a natural reaction of an individual exposed to a\nsurvivor’s trauma. A person who identifies too strongly with a survivor may take on that\nsurvivor’s feelings.\nTaking on the survivors’ feelings as your own can affect your ability to do your job as a\nrescuer and it can have long-term impact. Taking ownership of others’ problems will\ncompound your own stress and negatively affect your overall effectiveness.\nBe alert to signs of disaster trauma in yourself, as well as in disaster survivors and\nothers, such as fellow CERT volunteers, so you can take steps to alleviate stress. The\nterm “burnout” is different from trauma. Typically, individuals suffering from burnout can\novercome it by distancing themselves from their work for a period of time.\nThe Five Fs\nHumans typically have five primary responses to stress. We refer to those as the 5 Fs:\n(1) freeze, (2) flight, (3) fight, (4) fright, and (5) faint. Our bodies have both physical and\npsychological responses to stressful events. Recognizing examples of each of these\nresponses in both CERT volunteers and survivors can assist you in determining how\nbest to provide support.\n1. Freeze: “Stop, look, and listen,” or be on guard and watchful.\n2. Flight: Flee.\n3. Fight: Attempt to combat the threat.\n4. Fright: Tonic immobility when in contact with a predator or playing dead.\n5. Faint: Fear-induced fainting.\nPossible Psychological Symptoms\nYou may experience or observe others experience varied types of disaster-related\npsychological and physiological responses.\n• Emotional: nervousness; helplessness; shock; numbness; inability to feel love or\njoy; feelings of abandonment; agitation; feelings of detachment; exhilaration as a\nresult of surviving; unreal feelings; feelings of being out of control; instances of\ndenial; feelings of being overwhelmed; and feelings of fragility.\n• Cognitive: difficulty making decisions; occurrence of disturbing dreams;\nmemories and flashbacks; feelings of always being on guard or on constant alert;\nAugust 2019 Page 5-2"

It is worthwhile to spend the time and\neffort to find personal stress reducers before an incident occurs.\nYou can take the following preventive steps in your everyday life.\n• Get enough sleep.\n• Exercise regularly.\n• Eat a balanced diet.\n• Balance work, play, and rest.\n• Allow yourself to receive as well as give; you should remember that your identity\nis broader than that of a helper.\n• Connect with others.\n• Use spiritual resources.\nIn addition to preventive steps, you should explain to your loved ones and friends how\nto support you when you return from a disaster area.\n• Listen when you want to talk.\n• Do not force you to talk if you are not ready\nYou may also want to share with your loved ones and friends the information on\npossible disaster-related psychological and physiological symptoms discussed earlier.\nExercise 5.1: Self-Care Toolbox\nPurpose: This activity is to provide you with the opportunity to outline a number of self-\ncare tools that you can perform both before and during a crisis so that you are ready to\nrespond during an emergency.\nInstructions: Complete this activity individually and at your own pace.

Sharing the workload and emotional load\ncan help defuse pent-up emotions.\n• Encourage rescuers to rest and regroup to avoid becoming overtired.\n• Direct rescuers to take breaks away from the incident area for relief from the\nstress of the effort.\n• Establish a culture of acceptance amongst the team. Encourage volunteers to\nverbalize their experiences and normalize open communication.\n• Encourage rescuers to eat properly and maintain fluid intake during the\noperation. Encourage them to drink water or other electrolyte-replacing fluids,\navoiding drinks with caffeine or refined sugar.\n• Encourage volunteers to be aware of changes in their teammates that may\nindicate personal stress and the need for a break or change of assignment.\n• Rotate teams for breaks or new duties (e.g., from high-stress to low-stress jobs).\nEncourage volunteers to talk with each other about their experiences to promote\npsychological health.\n• Do not send home volunteers who just completed a high-stress operation;\ninstead, assign them to a low-stress responsibility so they can decompress\ngradually.\n• Conduct a brief discussion with rescue workers after their shift during which they\ncan describe and express their feelings about what they encountered.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-7"

      "text": "CERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: WORKING WITH SURVIVORS’ EMOTIONAL\nRESPONSES\nCrisis survivors can go through a variety of emotional phases, and as a rescuer, you\nshould be aware of what you may encounter. The conditions associated with evacuation\nand relocation have psychological significance. When there are physical hazards or\nfamily separations during the evacuation process, survivors often experience post-\ntraumatic reactions. When the family unit is not together due to shelter requirements or\nother factors, anxiety regarding the welfare of those not present may detract from the\nattention necessary for immediate problem solving.\n• Pre-Disaster Phase: Communities will have varying degrees of warning\ndepending on the type of disaster. For example, earthquakes typically hit without\nwarning; whereas, hurricanes and floods typically strike within hours to days of a\nwarning. When there is no warning, survivors may feel more vulnerable, unsafe,\nand fearful of future unpredicted tragedies. The perception they had no control\nover protecting themselves or their loved ones can be deeply distressing.\nMeanwhile, when people do not heed warnings and suffer losses as a result,\nthey may experience guilt and self-blame. While they may have specific plans for\nhow they might protect themselves in the future, survivors often feel guilty or\nresponsible for what has occurred.\n• Impact Phase: The impact phase of a disaster varies from the slow, low threat\nbuildup associated with some types of floods to the violent, dangerous, and\ndestructive outcomes associated with tornadoes and explosions. The greater the\nscope, community destruction, and personal losses associated with the disaster,\nthe greater the psychosocial effects.\nDepending on the characteristics of the incident, people's reactions may range\nfrom constricted, stunned, shock-like responses to the less common overt\nexpressions of panic and hysteria. Typically, people respond initially with\nconfusion and disbelief and focus on the survival and physical well-being of\nthemselves and their loved ones. When families are in different geographic\nlocations during the impact of a disaster (e.g., children at school, adults at work),\nsurvivors will experience considerable anxiety until reunification.\n• Heroic Phase: In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, survival, rescuing\nothers, and promoting safety are priorities. Evacuation to shelters, motels, or\nother homes may be necessary. For some, post-impact disorientation gives way\nto adrenaline-induced rescue behavior to save lives and protect property. While\nactivity level may be high, actual productivity is often low. The capacity to assess\nrisk may be impaired, and injuries can result. Altruism is prominent among both\nsurvivors and emergency responders.\n• Honeymoon Phase: In the weeks and months following a disaster, formal\ngovernmental and volunteer assistance may be readily available. Community\nbonding occurs from the shared experience of surviving a catastrophic\nexperience and the giving and receiving of community support. Survivors may\nexperience a short-lived sense of optimism that the help they will receive will\nmake them “whole” again. When disaster behavioral health workers are visible\nAugust 2019 Page 5-8"

      "text": "CERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nand perceived as helpful during this phase, they are more readily accepted and\nhave a foundation from which to aid in the difficult phases ahead.\n• Disillusionment Phase: Disappointment in a slower-than-expected pace of\nrecovery can trigger this phase. Disillusionment typically occurs in the second\nhalf of the year immediately following a disaster and, again, after the disaster’s\nfirst anniversary.\n• Reconstruction Phase: The reconstruction of physical property and recovery of\nemotional well-being may continue for years following a disaster. At this point,\nsurvivors have realized they will need to solve the problems of rebuilding their\nown homes, businesses, and lives largely by themselves and have gradually\nassumed the responsibility for doing so.\nTraumatic Crisis\nA traumatic crisis is an event experienced or witnessed in which people’s ability to cope\nis overwhelmed by:\n• Actual or potential death or injury to self or others;\n• Serious injury;\n• Destruction of their homes, neighborhood, or valued possessions; and/or\n• Loss of contact with family volunteers or close friends.\nTraumatic stress may affect:\n• Cognitive Function: Those who have suffered traumatic stress may act\nirrationally, in ways out of character for them, and they may have difficulty\nmaking decisions. Additionally, they may have difficulty sharing or retrieving\nmemories.\n• Physical Health: Traumatic stress can cause physical symptoms and health\nproblems.\n• Interpersonal Relationships: Survivors of traumatic stress may undergo\ntemporary or long-term personality changes that make interpersonal relationships\ndifficult.\nMediating Factors\nThe strength and type of personal reaction to trauma vary depending on a combination\nof the following factors:\n• A person’s prior experience with the same or a similar event; the emotional effect\nof multiple events can be cumulative, leading to greater stress reactions.\n• Intensity of the disruption in the survivors’ lives; the more the survivors’ lives are\ndisrupted, the greater their psychological and physiological reactions may\nbecome.\n• The meaning of the event to the individual; the more catastrophic the victim\nperceives the event to be to him or her personally, the more intense his or her\nstress reaction will be.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-9"

People who have had other recent traumas may not\ncope well with additional stresses.\n• The length of time that has elapsed between the event’s occurrence and the\npresent; the reality of the event takes time to “sink in.”\nCERT volunteers cannot know—and should never assume to know—what someone is\nthinking or feeling.\nDo not take the survivors’ surface attitudes personally. Rescuers should expect to see a\nrange of responses that will vary from person to person, but the responses they see will\nbe part of the psychological impact of the event—and probably will not relate to anything\nthat the CERTs have or have not done.\nStabilizing Survivors\nThe goal of on-scene psychological intervention on the part of CERT volunteers should\nbe to calm the incident scene by stabilizing individuals. Address any medical needs then\nuse the methods below to psychologically stabilize individuals.\n• Observe survivors to determine their level of responsiveness and decide whether\nthey pose a danger to themselves or to others.\n• Get uninjured people involved in helping. Engaging survivors in focused activity\nhelps them cope. Give them constructive jobs to do such as organizing supplies.\nThis strategy is especially effective for survivors who are being disruptive.\nProvide support by:\n• Listening: Let them talk about their feelings and their physical needs. Survivors\noften need to talk about what they have been through – and they may want\nsomeone to listen to them.\n• Empathizing: Caring responses show survivors that someone else shares their\nfeelings of pain and grief.\n• Connecting: Help survivors connect to natural support systems, such as family,\nfriends, or clergy.\nListen, Protect, Connect\nPsychological First Aid (PFA) is an evidence-informed approach to assist children,\nadolescents, adults, and families in a disaster’s aftermath. Just as you learned basic\nfirst aid in Units 3 and 4 to support the physical needs of survivors, PFA provides the\ninitial support for survivors’ psychological well-being. “Listen, Protect, Connect” is one\nmethod of PFA that can assist survivors in taking steps to bounce back more quickly.\n• Listen: The first important step to help your survivors after an event is to listen\nand pay attention to what they say (and how they say it), how they act, and what\nthey need right now. We talked previously about the many ways in which people\nmay react after experiencing a traumatic event. Remember that not all reactions\nare verbal or can be seen.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-10"

Understand that sometimes survivors are not ready to talk or\ndo not want to talk and that is okay. Check back with them on a regular basis to\nsee if their reactions or needs have changed.\n• Protect: This step helps survivors feel protected and allows you to protect them\nfrom added stress. This step helps survivors feel better by taking actions to\nprovide support, encouragement, and reassurance. The listening step should\nhave provided you with enough information to make informed decisions about\neach survivor’s needs.\n― Provide information or resources.\n― Answer questions simply and honestly, clearing up any confusion they\nmay have.\n― Empathize and let them know they are not alone in their reactions to the\nevent.\n― Provide opportunities for them to communicate, but do not force them.\n― Talk to them about what is being done to keep everyone safe from harm.\n― Watch for anything in the environment that could re-traumatize them such\nas sights, smells, or sounds and help them reduce contact with those\nelements.\n― Help them decide what their basic needs are and how to get access to\nthem (e.g., encouraging healthy behaviors such as food and rest).\n• Connect: Connecting survivors to their friends, loved ones, and other resources\nhas a positive impact on their recovery.\n― Assist survivors in reconnecting with friends or loved ones after a disaster.\n― Ensure you are connecting with them on a regular basis.\n― Help them find access to resources that can offer support.\nBeing an Empathetic Listener\nBeing an empathetic listener requires the listener to listen and to let the survivor talk.\nGood listeners will:\n• Put the listener in the speaker’s shoes to understand the speaker’s point of view\nmore profoundly. Draw upon experiences or try to imagine how the speaker is\nfeeling. To limit the effects of vicarious trauma, be careful not to completely take\non the speaker’s feelings.\n• Listen for meaning, not just words, and pay close attention to the speaker’s\nnonverbal communication, such as body language, facial expressions, and tone\nof voice.\n• Paraphrase the speaker periodically to make sure he or she fully understood\nwhat the speaker said and to indicate to the speaker that you are listening. This\nreinforces the communication process.\nSurvivors can show evidence of being suicidal, psychotic, or unable to care for\nthemselves. Be sure to refer these cases to EMS and/or mental health professionals for\nsupport as soon as possible.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-11"

On the surface,\nyou may say these phrases to comfort the survivors, but they can be misinterpreted or\nnot well received. In general, avoid the statements below:\n• “I understand.” In most situations, we cannot understand unless we have had the\nsame experience.\n• “Don’t feel bad.” The survivor has a right to feel bad and will need time to feel\ndifferently.\n• “You’re strong” or “You’ll get through this.” Many survivors do not feel strong and\nquestion if they will recover from the loss.\n• “Don’t cry.” It is okay to cry.\n• “It’s God’s will.” With a person you do not know, giving religious meaning to an\nevent may insult or anger the person.\n• “It could be worse,” “At least you still have…”, or “Everything will be okay.” It is up\nto the individual to decide whether things could be worse or if everything will be\nokay.\nRather than provide comfort, these types of responses could elicit a strong negative\nresponse or distance the survivor from the listener.\nIt is okay to apologize if the survivor reacts negatively to something you said.\nLearn to be comfortable with silence. Do not say something just to alleviate your own\ndiscomfort.\nSay This Instead\nAlways ask permission to enter their space, provide help, or interact with them.\nAllow people to say what they need. Normalize what they are feeling and thinking using\ncommon phrases similar to those below.\n• “I’m sorry for your pain.”\n• “I’m so sorry this has happened.”\n• “Is it all right if I help you with…?”\n• “I can’t imagine what this is like for you.”\n• “What do you need?”\nManaging Death Scene\nOne unpleasant task that CERT volunteers may face is dealing with a victim who dies\nwhile under the team’s care. The guidelines below are useful for dealing with this\nsituation.\n• Cover the body; treat it with respect.\n• Follow local laws and protocols for handling the deceased.\n• Talk with local authorities to determine the plan.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-12"

Explain the role CERTs play in fire safety and response, including the CERT\nsize-up process and minimum safety precautions.\n2. Extinguish a small fire using a fire extinguisher.\n3. Identify and reduce potential fire, utility, and hazardous materials hazards at\nhome and in the community.\nRole of CERTs\nCERTs play a very important role in fire and utility safety by supporting the following\nactions.\n• Extinguishing small fires before they become major fires.\n― This unit will provide training on how to use an extinguisher to put out\nsmall fires and how to recognize when a fire is too big to handle. As a rule,\nif you cannot put out a fire in five seconds, it is already too big to handle,\nand you should leave the premises immediately.\n• Preventing additional fires by removing fuel sources.\n― This unit will describe how to perform an “overhaul,” the process to ensure\nyou extinguish a fire completely and permanently.\n• Shutting off utilities when necessary and safe to do so.\n― This unit will review utility shutoff procedures taught in Unit 1.\n• Assisting with evacuations where necessary.\n― When a fire is beyond the ability of CERTs to extinguish or a utility\nemergency has occurred, CERT volunteers need to protect lives by\nevacuating the area and establishing a perimeter, while also notifying fire\nservices of the situation.\nCERT Priorities\nCERTs play a very important role in neighborhood and workplace fire and utility safety.\nCERT volunteers help in fire- and utility-related emergencies before professional\nresponders arrive. When responding, CERT volunteers should keep in mind the\nfollowing CERT standards:\nRescuer safety is always the number one priority. Therefore, CERT volunteers should\nalways:\n• Use the buddy system. Buddies serve an important purpose. They protect your\nsafety. Do not ever try to fight a fire alone.

The type and quantity of\nthe fuel will determine which method you should use to extinguish the fire.\n• Oxygen: Most fires will burn vigorously in any atmosphere of at least 20 percent\noxygen. Without oxygen, most fuels could be heated until entirely consumed yet\nthey would not burn.\nThese three elements, called the fire triangle, create a chemical exothermic reaction,\nwhich is fire.\nImage 6.1: Fire Triangle\nClasses of Fires\nTo aid in distinguishing types of fires, fires are categorized into classes based on the\ntype of fuel that is burning.\n• Class A Fires: Ordinary combustibles, such as paper, cloth, wood, rubber, and\nmany plastics.\n• Class B Fires: Flammable liquids, including oils and gasoline as well as\ncombustible liquids such as charcoal lighter fluid and kerosene.

Your personal\nsafety must always be your number one concern. You will be unable to help anyone if\nyou have injured yourself through careless size-up or unsafe acts.\nFire Suppression Safety Rules\nVolunteers should follow all rules regarding fire suppression safety.\n• Use safety equipment at all times. Wear your helmet, goggles, dust mask, leather\ngloves, and sturdy shoes or boots. If you are not equipped to protect your\npersonal safety, leave the building.\n• Work with a buddy. Buddies serve an important purpose. They protect your\nsafety. Do not ever try to fight a fire alone. Stick together at all times.\n• Have a backup team, whenever possible. A backup team can support your fire\nsuppression efforts and can provide help if you need it.\n• Always have two ways to exit the fire area. Fires spread much faster than you\nmight think. Always have a backup escape plan in case your main escape route\nbecomes blocked.\n• Look at the door. If air is being sucked under the door or smoke is seeping out\nthe top of the door, do not touch or open the door.\n• Feel closed doors with the back of the hand, working from the bottom of the door\nup including the space between the door and its frame. Do not touch the door\nhandle before feeling the door. If the door is hot, there is fire behind it. Do not\nenter! Opening the door will feed additional oxygen to the fire.\n• Confine the fire, whenever possible, by closing doors and keeping them closed.\n• Stay low to the ground. Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of fire-related\ndeaths. Smoke will naturally rise and keeping low to the ground will provide you\nwith fresher air to breathe.\n• Maintain a safe distance. Remember the effective range of your fire extinguisher.\nDo not get closer than necessary to extinguish the fire.\n• Never turn your back on a fire when backing out.\n• Overhaul the fire to be sure that it is extinguished—and stays extinguished.\nSometimes, what CERTs should not do when suppressing fires is just as important as\nwhat they should do.\n• DO NOT get too close. Stay near the outer range of your extinguisher. If you feel\nthe heat, you are too close.\n• DO NOT try to fight a fire alone. Remember your first priority is your personal\nsafety. Do not put it at risk.\n• DO NOT try to suppress large fires. Learn the capability of your equipment, and\ndo not try to suppress a fire that is clearly too large for the equipment at hand\n(e.g., a fire that is larger than the combined ratings of available fire\nextinguishers).\n• DO NOT enter smoke-filled areas. Suppressing fires in smoke-filled areas\nrequires equipment that CERTs do not have.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-12"

Most of\nthese hazards fall into the following categories:\n• Electrical hazards;\n• Natural gas hazards; or\n• Flammable or combustible liquids.\nHomes and workplaces can and do have other hazards, including incompatible\nmaterials stored in close proximity to each other, such as flammables/combustibles,\ncorrosives, compressed gases, and explosives. Simple fire prevention measures will\nhelp reduce the likelihood of fires:\n• First, locate potential sources of ignition; then\n• Do what you can to reduce or eliminate the hazards.\nElectrical Hazards\nHere are some examples of common electrical hazards and simple ways CERT\nvolunteers can reduce or eliminate them, such as:\n• Avoid the “electrical octopus.” Eliminate tangles of electrical cords.\n• Do not overload electrical outlets.\n• Do not plug power strips into other power strips.\n• Do not run electrical cords under carpets.\n• Check for and replace broken or frayed cords\n• Maintain electrical appliances. Repair or replace malfunctioning appliances.\nResponding to Electrical Emergencies\nElectrical emergencies sometimes occur despite our best efforts. In the event of an\nelectrical emergency, first responders, and even knowledgeable members of the\nhousehold can take the following steps:\n• Locate the circuit breakers or fuses and know how to shut off the power. Post\nshutoff instructions next to the breaker box or fuse box.\n• Unscrew individual fuses or switch off smaller breakers first, then pull the main\nswitch or breaker.\n• When turning the power back on, turn on the main switch or breaker first, then\nscrew in the fuses or switch on the smaller breakers, one at a time.\nBe certain to notify a licensed electrician and/or utility company in the event of an\nelectrical emergency or fire.\nYou should not enter a flooded basement or wade into standing water to shut off the\nelectrical supply because water conducts electricity.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-14"

It is an asphyxiant, which displaces oxygen\nin the body, and it is flammable meaning it can readily ignite under the right conditions\nIt is important to recognize that natural gas is lighter than air, and to understand that you\nwill likely not be able to feel the gas in the event of a leak. Therefore, you should place\nnatural gas detectors as you would smoke alarms, strategically on every level of your\nhome. Common places to place natural gas detectors are near the furnace, hot water\ntank, and other gas appliances such as a clothes dryer or stove. Test the detector\nmonthly to ensure it works.\nCarbon Monoxide\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly, colorless, odorless, poisonous gas that, like natural\ngas, is lighter than air. The incomplete burning of various fuels, including natural gas, is\nresponsible for producing CO. Malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces,\nranges, water heaters and room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable\ngenerators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas\nare at risk for producing CO.\nTo prevent CO poisoning, install carbon monoxide detectors, which meet the current\nsafety standards near all separate sleeping areas. You should install additional\ndetectors on every level of the home and in every bedroom. Do not place detectors\nwithin 15 feet of heating or cooking appliances or in or near very humid areas such as\nbathrooms. Test the detector monthly to ensure it works.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-15"

If you are unsure of how to shut off the gas\nproperly and safely, you should never attempt to do so. Contact your local gas company\nfor assistance.\nImage 6.7: Natural Gas Meter with Shutoff\nThe gas meter shutoff diagram indicates the shutoff valve location on the pipe that comes out of\nthe ground. To turn off the valve, use a non-sparking wrench to turn the valve clockwise one-\nquarter turn. Remember that, in all cases, only a licensed technician should turn on natural gas\nflow.\nPlease note: Some gas meters have automatic shutoff valves that restrict the flow of\ngas during an earthquake or other emergency. A licensed plumber installs these,\ndownstream of the utility point of delivery. If you are unsure whether your home has this\nshutoff device, contact your gas service company. If this shutoff device is closed, only a\nqualified professional should restore it.\nGas Meter Inside the Home\nIf your gas meter is located inside your home, you should only shut off the gas flow\nwhen instructed to by local authorities. If you smell gas or see the dials on your meter\nshowing gas is flowing even though your appliances are off, you should evacuate the\npremises and call 9-1-1. Do not attempt to shut off the gas from inside the building if gas\nmay be in the air.\nGas Meter Outside the Home\nYou should turn off the meter from outside the building if you smell gas or you see dials\non the meter showing gas is flowing even though appliances are off.

Their\nlabels tell the types of fires for which they are effective and the area that they can\nsuppress.\n• When using portable fire extinguishers, remember P.A.S.S.: Pull, Aim, Squeeze,\nand Sweep. Always test the extinguisher after pulling the pin.\n• When suppressing a fire, always follow the safety rules established for CERTs.\n• There are several methods of placarding hazardous materials being stored or\ntransported, including NFPA, DOT, UN, and NA placards, to help volunteers\nunderstand the types of materials found at a specific location. When faced with\naccidents involving hazardous or unknown materials, volunteers should keep\naway and call for professional help immediately.\nHomework Assignment\nBefore the next session, you should:\nRead and familiarize yourself with the unit that will be covered in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-23"

Identify and apply CERT size-up requirements for potential search and rescue\nsituations;\n2. Demonstrate the most common techniques for light search and rescue; and\n3. Demonstrate safe techniques for debris removal and survivor extrication during\nsearch and rescue operations.\nUnit Overview\nSearch and rescue consist of three separate operations:\n1. Size-up involves assessing the situation and determining a safe action plan\n(using the nine-step size-up model).\n2. Search involves locating survivors and documenting their location.\n3. Rescue involves the procedures and methods required to extricate the survivors.\nPrevious disasters have shown that the first response to trapped survivors immediately\nafter almost every disaster is by spontaneous, untrained, and well-intentioned persons\nwho rush to the site of a collapse in an attempt to free the survivors.\nOften, these spontaneous rescue efforts result in serious injuries and compounded\nproblems. Plan and practice rescue efforts in advance. People, including rescuers, have\ndied when the rescuers were not prepared and trained.\nDeciding to Attempt Rescue\nThe decision to attempt a rescue should be based on three factors:\n1. Risks involved to both the rescuer and the survivor;\n2. The overall goal of doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people;\nand\n3. Resources and labor available.\nGoals of Search and Rescue\nThe goals of search and rescue operations are to:\n• Rescue the greatest number of people in the shortest amount of time;\n• Get the walking wounded and ambulatory survivors out first;\n• Rescue lightly trapped survivors next; and\n• Keep the rescuers and survivors safe.\nEffective Search and Rescue\nEffective search and rescue operations hinge on:\n• Effective size-up;\n• Rescuer safety; and\nAugust 2019 Page 7-1"

When gathering\nfacts, CERT volunteers need to consider:\n• The time of the event and day of the week.\n― At night, more people will be in their homes, so the greatest need for\nsearch and rescue will be in residential settings. Conversely, during the\nday, people will be at work, so the need will be in commercial buildings.\nThe locations of people in their homes and the amount of daylight\navailable may also affect search and rescue operations.\n• Construction type and terrain.\n― Some types of construction are more susceptible to damage and the type\nof terrain will affect how best to conduct the search.\n• Occupancy.\n― The design purpose of the structure may indicate the likely number of\nsurvivors and their location.\n• Weather.\n― Severe weather will impact survivors and rescuers alike and will hamper\nrescue efforts. Consider forecasts of severe weather as a limiting factor on\nthe period during which search and rescue can occur.\n• Hazards.\n― Knowledge of other potential hazards in the general and immediate areas\nis important to search and rescue efforts. For example, if you suspect a\ngas leak, taking the time to locate and shut off the gas can have a big\nimpact in terms of loss of life.\nExercise 7.1: Gathering Facts\nPurpose: This exercise will give you the opportunity to consider some of the facts that\nCERT search and rescue teams will need to gather during size-up.\nInstructions:\n• Refer to the Scenario handout.\n• Brainstorm the following questions:\n― What does this scenario tell you about the probable density for the\naffected area?\n― What does this scenario tell you about the facts that volunteers must\ngather?\n― What impact could these facts have on search and rescue operations?\n― What kinds of search and rescue operations are probable?\n― What, if any, are the constraints that search and rescue personnel may\nface in this scenario?\nAugust 2019 Page 7-5"

If so, how?\nScenario\nAt 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 9, a squall line passed through your town. Because of\nthe difference in barometric pressure on either side of the front, a “gust front” with\nstraight-line winds of more than 70 miles per hour preceded the squall line. Continued\nstrong winds and extremely heavy rain followed the gust front. The town loses\nelectricity.\nYou activate in accordance with your CERT program’s standard operating procedures\n(SOPs). On the way to the staging area at the local high school, you notice considerable\ndamage, including felled trees and utility lines. Many streets are impassable, making\nyou take a roundabout route to the high school. As you make your way to the staging\narea, you see that the roof has blown off of a large portion of a local shopping center\nand that the exterior wall on the west end of the structure has collapsed.\nAfter reaching the staging area, you check in with the Logistics Team Leader, who\nassigns you to Search and Rescue Team 2. Although CERT volunteers cannot venture\ninto the section of the shopping center that has collapsed, Search and Rescue Team 2\nwill be searching near the collapsed area to see if there are survivors in that area.\nStep 2: Assess and Communicate Damage\nThere are general guidelines for assessing damage in interior searches and exterior\nsearches. When in doubt about the condition of a building, CERT volunteers should\nalways use the more cautious assessment. If you are unsure about whether damage to\na building is moderate or heavy, CERT volunteers should assume heavy damage. The\nCERT mission changes depending on the amount of structural damage.\nCERT Mission and Types of Damages\nThe CERT mission for interior searches depends on if damage is light, moderate, or\nheavy.\nDamage is Light\nThe CERT mission is to locate; assess; treat airway, major bleeding, and low body\ntemperature; continue size-up; and document.\nLight damage includes:\n• Superficial damage;\n• Broken windows;\n• Superficial cracks or breaks in the wall surface, for example, fallen or cracked\nplaster; and\n• Minor damage to the interior contents.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-6"

Be sure to do an initial \"lap around\" the building.\nIn assessing damage, CERT personnel must consider probable levels of damage based\non the type and age of construction.\nIn addition to a visual assessment, rescuers should also “listen” to damaged structures.\nIf a building is creaking or “groaning,” it is unstable and volunteers should not enter it.\nCommunicating Damage\nYou can describe different locations within and around the structure by using the ABCD\nstandard, with A corresponding to the front of the building and B, C, and D representing\nthe sides of the building moving clockwise from A.\nUsing this system, volunteers can break down the area inside of a structure by\nquadrants to facilitate communication. For instance, a hazard or survivor located closest\nto the A and B sides of the structure is in the A/B quadrant.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-7"

It will not take CERT volunteers much time to answer these types of\nquestions, but the answers could make a huge difference in how they\napproach the search.\n• What secondary factors should CERT volunteers consider?\n― Take a moment to look around and assess the situation outside of the\nimmediate area. What is the weather doing? Is the wind changing? Is a\nstorm moving in that would affect the response? Is there a crowd growing?\nAre there very few people around? Do you hear first responders in the\ndistance, or is everything quiet?\n• What else could go wrong?\n― Based on the information gathered during Steps 1 and 2 of the size-up,\nCERT volunteers should take a few moments to play “What if?” to try to\nidentify additional risks that they may face. What happens if the power\ngoes out during the search? What if a wall that appears stable shifts and\ncollapses? Applying “Murphy’s Law” to the situation could save CERT\nvolunteers’ lives.\n• What does it all mean for the search and rescue?\n― Based on the probabilities, CERTs should think about what they can do to\nreduce the risks associated with the probabilities that they have identified.\nIs a spotter necessary to look for movement that could indicate a possible\ncollapse and warn the rescue team? Is some remedial action required to\nstabilize nonstructural hazards before beginning the search? CERT\nsearch and rescue teams must remember that their own safety is the\npriority.\nStep 4: Assess Your Situation\nRemember that size-up is a compounding process, with each step building upon the\nprevious steps until the decision is made to either begin the search and rescue\noperation or that the situation is not safe to begin. You need to draw on everything you\nlearned from Steps 1 through 3 to assess your situation to determine:\n• Whether the situation is safe enough to continue;\n• The risks that rescuers will face if they continue; and\n• The available resources volunteers will need to conduct the operation safely.\nAssessing resources, including personnel, tools, and equipment, is extremely important\nto search and rescue operations.\nRescue Resources\nSearch and rescue resources include personnel, equipment, and tools.

For example, volunteers must complete the task of removing or\nmitigating known hazards before teams begin to search.

The search operation involves two\nprocesses:\n• Employing search techniques based on the size-up; and\n• Locating survivors.\nBy using these processes, search operations will be more efficient, thorough, and safe.\nThey will also facilitate later rescue operations. Although the processes are related, this\nsection addresses them one at a time. Interior search operations are the most common\nand discussed first; exterior search operations will be discussed later in this unit.\nLocating Potential Survivors in a Structure\nThe first step in locating potential survivors in a structure is to gather more precise\ninformation about damage and to develop priorities and plans by conducting a size-up\nof the interior of the building. The data gathered will provide more information about\npossible areas of entrapment or voids.\nStructural Voids\nThere are several types of structural voids:\n• Pancake void\n• Lean-to void\n• “V” void\nSurvivors may be trapped in a structural void. If you hear any signs of life coming from a\nstructural void, report it to the TL immediately and make appropriate markings to direct\nprofessional rescuers, but do not attempt the rescue yourself. Attempting to rescue a\nperson from a structural void without proper equipment may result in completing the\ncollapse and harming the trapped person.\nIf CERT volunteers see collapsed floors or walls, they should leave the premises\nimmediately.\nIndividual Voids\nIndividual voids are spaces into which the survivor may have crawled for protection.\nExamples of individual voids include bathtubs and the space underneath desks.\nChildren may seek shelter in smaller places like cabinets.\nAfter identifying the possible areas of entrapment, CERT volunteers must:\n• Determine the potential number of survivors; and\n• Identify the most probable areas of entrapment.\nSome information may be known through assessment, but CERT volunteers may need\nto get some information by talking to bystanders or those who are familiar with the\nstructure.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-14"

They may tend to exaggerate\npotential numbers or may not even remember the event accurately. Gather as much\ninformation as you can, though, because it will be useful for planning search priorities\nand implementing the search.\nSearch Methodology\nAn effective search methodology:\n• Indicates rescuer location;\n• Locates survivors as quickly and safely as possible; and\n• Prevents duplication of effort.\nSearch Markings\nExperienced search and rescue personnel use the following system. CERTs will use the\nsame system. This will save time for fellow CERT volunteers and other responders\nduring the search and continual size-up of the structure.\nUpon entering a search area, you will make a mark next to the door to indicate that you\nare entering. Do not make the mark on the door or on the wall where the door swings.\nMake a single slash and write the agency or group ID at the “9 o’clock” position. Then\nwrite the date and “time in” at the “12 o’clock” position.\nUpon exiting the search area, make another slash to form an “X” (the agency or group\nID will be in the left quadrant). Enter the search “time out” In the top quadrant.\n• Right quadrant: Enter the areas of the structure searched and any specific\ninformation about hazards.\n• Lower quadrant: Enter information about the survivors found in the search area.\n“L” represents living and “D” represents dead. The search marking on the front of\na structure or building should contain the total number of survivors, whereas\nsearch markings inside the structure or building will include survivor totals for\nspecific search areas. Indicate where survivors were taken.\nSearch Methodology\n• Use the buddy system.\n― Always remain within arm’s reach of at least one other CERT volunteer\nwhen conducting an interior search. This is to enable assistance in the\nevent of a slip or a fall and to be able to push or pull one another out of\nharm's way.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-15"

Ensure that all areas of the building are covered.\nExamples of systematic search patterns to use include:\n• Bottom-up/top-down; and\n• Right wall/left wall.\nKeep in mind that every interior space has six sides — including the floor and ceiling.\nRescuers must check all six sides to locate hazards such as fixtures that may be\nhanging from the ceiling\n• Stop frequently to listen: Listen for tapping, movement, or voices.\n• Triangulate: Consider using triangulation when a potential survivor’s location is\nobscured. If access permits, three rescuers, guided by survivor sounds, form a\ntriangle around the area and direct flashlights into the area. The light shining from\ndifferent directions will eliminate shadows that could otherwise hide survivors.\nTriangulation should not be used as an initial search method.\n• Report results: Keep complete records both of removed survivors and of\nsurvivors who remain trapped or are dead. Report this information to emergency\nservices personnel when they reach the scene.\nExterior Search\nIn addition to searching inside a structure, CERT volunteers may need to search open\nareas outside of buildings.\nConducting an effective search in open areas requires that searchers work methodically\nand follow standard procedures established by those in charge of the search operation.\nThis is true in all cases, especially if the area is a crime scene, where all potential\nevidence must be protected.\nIf searchers are needed, they should assemble in a central staging area and sign in.\nAuthorities will brief the searchers on what they will be looking for, what areas they are\nresponsible for searching, the pattern of the search, and what they should do if they\ndiscover the missing person, evidence, or related information.\nExterior search patterns include grid, line, quadrant or zone, and spiral. Typically, a grid\npattern is used in large open areas or small areas when a hands-and-knees search is\nconducted.\nGrid is one of the most commonly used types of search patterns. Keep the guidelines\nbelow in mind when conducting a grid search.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-16"

Moving objects and debris to create a safe rescue environment and free\nsurvivors;\n2. Assessing survivors, checking for life-threatening conditions such as airway\nobstruction, severe bleeding, and low body temperature; and\n3. Removing survivors as safely and as quickly as possible.\nCreating a Safe Environment\nThere are three safety considerations for all rescue operations:\n1. Maintain rescuer safety;\n2. Assess survivors in lightly and moderately damaged buildings; and\n3. Evacuate survivors as quickly as possible from moderately damaged buildings\nwhile minimizing additional injury.\nCERTs cannot achieve these considerations without creating as safe an environment as\npossible before attempting rescue. Therefore, there are certain precautions that\nrescuers must take to minimize risk.\nPrecautions to Minimize Risk\nThere are certain precautions that rescuers must take to minimize risk and increase\ntheir chances of achieving their rescue goals.\n• Know Your Limitations: Many volunteers have been injured or killed during\nrescue operations because they did not pay attention to their own physical and\nmental limitations. CERT rescuers should take the time to drink fluids, eat, relax,\nand rest so that they can return with a clear mind and improved energy.\n• Follow Safety Procedures: CERT volunteers should always use the proper\nsafety equipment required for the situation and follow established procedures,\nincluding:\n― Work in pairs.\n― Assess and treat only in lightly damaged buildings.\n― In moderately damaged buildings, assess only and remove survivors as\nquickly as possible.\n― Never enter an unstable structure.\n― Lift by bending the knees, keeping the back straight, and pushing up with\nthe legs.\n― Carry the load close to the body.\n― Lift and carry no more than is reasonable.\n• Remove Debris: Remove debris as needed to minimize risk to rescuers and to\nfree entrapped survivors.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-18"

In\nthese situations, CERT rescuers should consider leveraging and cribbing to move and\nstabilize the debris until the rescue is complete.\n• Leveraging is accomplished by wedging a lever under the object that needs to be\nmoved, with a stationary object underneath it to act as a fulcrum. When the lever\nis forced down over the fulcrum, the far end of the lever will lift the object.\n• A crib is a wooden framework used for support or strengthening the object.\n― Box cribbing means arranging pairs of wood pieces alternately to form a\nstable rectangle.\n― You may use a variety of cribbing materials for these procedures and you\nwill need to improvise by using materials such as tires or structural debris.\nWhatever you use, do not put form over function.\nVolunteers may use leveraging and cribbing together by alternately lifting the object and\nplacing cribbing materials underneath the lifted edge to stabilize it.\nSafety is number one: \"Lift an inch; crib an inch.\" Leveraging and cribbing should be\ngradual for stability, safety, and efficiency.\nIt may also be necessary to use leveraging and cribbing at more than one location (e.g.,\nfront and back) to ensure stability. Never leverage and crib on opposite ends at the\nsame time because doing so will increase the instability of the debris. If leveraging is\nrequired at both ends, lift and crib at one end, then repeat the process at the other end.\nPositioning the lever and the fulcrum correctly is critical for safe operations. The fulcrum\nand pry tool must be perpendicular (90 degrees) to the edge of the object being lifted.\nAttempting to leverage a heavy object using too sharp an angle is inefficient and can\nresult in back injury.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-19"

When such material is not available, “unboxed” cribbing can also work effectively\nto support and stabilize the heavy object.\nWhen you are able to achieve sufficient lift, you should remove the survivor and reverse\nthe leveraging and cribbing procedure to lower the object. You should never leave an\nunsafe condition unless the event has left the structure or building obviously\ncompromised.\nWhen you must remove debris to locate survivors, you should set up a human chain\nand pass the debris from one person to the next. Be careful, however, to set up the\nchain in a position that will not interfere with rescue operations.\nWear your PPE to protect yourself always. Kneepads can be an important addition to\nyour PPE during rescue operations.\nLeveraging and Cribbing Steps\nStep 1: Conduct a size-up of the scene. Gather facts, identify hazards, and establish\npriorities.\nStep 2: Have one person in charge and formulate a plan of action, based upon the\ninformation you have received, to identify how and where to lift and crib and to\ndetermine how you will remove the survivor from underneath the debris.\nStep 3: Gather necessary materials for lifting/cribbing operations: lever, fulcrum,\ncribbing blocks, spacers/wedges. During an actual emergency, you may have to use\ncreative, substitute materials.\nStep 4: Use cribbing materials to stabilize the object prior to lifting.\nStep 5: Distribute cribbing materials as necessary to be readily accessible during the\nlifting operation.\nStep 6: Prepare to lift the object: Assemble the lever and fulcrum at the previously\nidentified location.\nStep 7: Assign a person to monitor and be ready to remove the survivor as soon as\npossible.\nStep 8: Initiate the lift, using the lever and fulcrum for mechanical advantage.\nStep 9: As the object is lifted, add cribbing as needed, one layer at a time.\nStep 10: Once the object is adequately supported, remove the lever and fulcrum. You\nmay then remove the survivor.\nStep 11: Unless the event has left the structure obviously compromised, requiring you\nto evacuate immediately, reinitiate the lift and begin removing cribbing materials,\nreversing the process by which you built the crib.\nStep 12: Progressively lower the object to the ground. Always return the heavy object to\na stable position unless you have to evacuate immediately.\nStep 13: Before you leave, remember to collect the lifting/cribbing supplies to be\navailable for additional operations.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-20"

Be aware\nthat ambulatory survivors are not always as strong and free of injury as they believe.\nWhen survivors are freed, they may need assistance to exit the structure.\nExtrication Method\nThe type of extrication method selected should depend on the:\n• General stability of the immediate environment;\n• Number of rescuers available;\n• Strength and ability of the rescuers; and\n• Condition of the survivor.\nIf safety and time permit, you should not use lifts and drags to remove survivors when\nyou suspect the survivors have closed-head or spinal injuries. In such cases, stabilize\nthe spine using a backboard. You can use doors, tables, and similar materials as\nimprovised backboards. The backboard must be able to carry the person and remember\nto use proper lifting techniques.\nWhen moving survivors, rescuers must use teamwork and communication and try to\nkeep the survivor's spine in a straight line.

Your mission\nwhen dealing with heavily damaged structures or situations that are clearly\nunsafe (e.g., rising or swiftly moving water) is to warn others.\n• Search and rescue size-up follows the same process as other CERT size-up\noperations. Size-up continues throughout search and rescue efforts and provides\ninformation about how to proceed. Remember: the CERT mission is to ensure\nsafety and organization during the evaluation. Therefore, if the size-up indicates\nthat evacuation of the team is necessary, do so immediately.\n• When the decision to begin search operations is made, CERT searchers must:\n― Remember that the first priority is volunteer safety;\n― Employ appropriate search techniques; and\n― Locate any survivors and check for life threatening injuries.\n• Locating survivors means completing a size-up of the building interior to identify\nareas of entrapment, then conducting a search that:\n― Is systematic and thorough;\n― Avoids unnecessary duplication of effort; and\n― Documents results.\n• Rescue involves these main functions:\n― Moving objects and debris to create a safe rescue environment and free\nsurvivors;\n― Assessing or stabilizing survivors by checking for life-threatening\nconditions (airway obstruction, severe bleeding, and low body\ntemperature); and\n― Removing survivors as safely and as quickly as possible based on the\nsize-up.\n• Remember that rescuer safety is always the top priority.\n• Rescue operations hinge on maintaining rescuer safety, which requires CERT\nvolunteers to recognize their own limitations. CERT volunteers should never\nattempt anything that exceeds their limitations at that point in time.\n• Rescuers may leverage and crib to lift heavy debris and give access to trapped\nsurvivors.\n• Rescuers can remove survivors in several ways, depending on:\n― Their condition;\nAugust 2019 Page 7-28"

Attackers seek to portray the government as ineffective,\nweak, and/or otherwise incapable.\nTerrorist attacks are often perpetrated by ideological extremists who are prepared to die\nin what they consider a symbolic sacrifice or act of martyrdom. Attackers frequently\nexploit social media seeking to spread misinformation and broadcast their actions to\naudiences around the globe, with the desire of increasing fear while simultaneously\nbolstering their credibility and legitimacy with like-minded supporters.\nNew Tactics\nRecently, terrorist attacks have trended away from large resource intensive plots such\nas the September 11 attacks to more decentralized, less sophisticated attacks like\nthose in Paris, France in 2016. Attackers have favored smaller, less centrally controlled\nnetworks, using more simplistic and accessible means such as guns and homemade\nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs). These components are easier to acquire, control,\nand conceal than large high-yield explosives, biological, radiological, or nuclear devices.\nAlthough there is always some risk from CBRNE type incidents and the United States\nremains vigilant against these threats, it is difficult to obtain and deploy these types of\nweapons.\nActive Shooter\nAn Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people\nin a confined and populated area. In most cases, active shooters use firearms(s) and\nthere is no pattern or method to their selection of targets. Active shooter situations are\nunpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law\nenforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate harm to survivors.\nMany recent terrorist attacks have included armed individuals with some training\nindiscriminately shooting civilians; although the motivations are different than a single\nactive shooter, the results are similar: rapidly accumulating casualties in a contained\nspace.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-2"

      "text": "CERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nImprovised Explosive Devices\nAn IED attack is the use of a “homemade” bomb and/or destructive device to destroy,\nincapacitate, harass, or distract. Because they are improvised, IEDs can come in many\nforms, ranging from a small pipe bomb to a sophisticated device capable of causing\nmassive damage and loss of life.\nTerrorist networks both domestic and abroad have published numerous sets of\ninstructions on how to make homemade explosives. IEDs consist of a variety of\ncomponents that include an initiator, switch, main charge, power source, and a\ncontainer. IEDs can be worn (belts, vests), carried (bags, backpacks, containers of all\nsizes/types), or transported in a vehicle; placed or thrown by a person; delivered in a\npackage; or concealed on the roadside.\nTo gain a better understanding of the impact that IEDs can have, the table below\nillustrates the damage radius cause by various sizes and types of IEDs.\nImage 8.1: IED Impact\nIEDs may be surrounded by or packed with additional materials or “enhancements”\nsuch as nails, glass, or metal fragments designed to increase the amount of shrapnel\npropelled by the explosion to maximize casualties. Enhancements may also include\nother elements such as hazardous materials. An IED can be initiated by a variety of\nmethods depending on the intended target.\nComplex Coordinated Terrorist Attacks\nA complex coordinated terrorist attack is a synchronized attack, conducted by two or\nmore semi-independent teams at multiple locations in close succession, initiated with\nlittle or no warning, using well trained attackers and employing one or more of the\nfollowing: fire arms, explosives, and fire as a weapon.\nAs seen in Paris, France in 2016, attackers have coordinated their actions to hit multiple\ntargets nearly simultaneously. When conducting these attacks, there may be pre-\nplanned coordination as well as real-time coordination between attackers. These\nattacks can be extremely lethal in a relatively short period of time.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-3"

This is known as cyberterrorism. To help guard against cyberterrorism, it is\nimportant that computer users implement appropriate security measures.\nCybersecurity involves protecting infrastructure by preventing, detecting, and\nresponding to cyber incidents. Unlike physical threats that prompt immediate action—\nlike stop, drop, and roll in the event of a fire—cyber threats are often difficult to identify\nand comprehend. Among these dangers are viruses erasing entire systems, intruders\nbreaking into systems and altering files, intruders using your computer or device to\nattack others, or intruders stealing confidential information. The spectrum of cyber risks\nis limitless. Threats, some more serious and sophisticated than others, can have wide-\nranging effects at the individual, community, organizational, and national levels.\n• Organized cybercrime, state-sponsored hackers, and cyber espionage can pose\nnational security risks to our country.\n• Transportation, power, and other services may be disrupted by large-scale cyber\nincidents. The extent of the disruption will be determined by many factors such\nas the target and size of the incident.\n• Vulnerability to data breach and loss increases if an organization’s network is\ncompromised. Information about a company, its employees, and its customers\ncan be at risk.\n• Individually-owned devices such as computers, tablets, mobile phones, and\ngaming systems that connect to the Internet are vulnerable to intrusion. Personal\ninformation may be at risk without proper security.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-4"

The\nphrase, “If you see something, say something,” took on additional power after the foiled\nTimes Square bomb plot in New York City. On May 1, 2010, street vendors in Times\nSquare noticed a smoking SUV with its blinkers on, engine running, and no one inside.\nThey decided to say something to a police officer. Thousands of people cleared from\nthe area while the bomb was dismantled.\nEight Signs of Terrorism\nThe presence of even a few signs may indicate the possibility of a terrorist attack. It is\nimportant to understand what these signs may look like as they are executed so you are\nable to identify them within your community. If you recognize one of these signs being\nacted out, it is important to contact your local law enforcement and effectively\ncommunicate the suspicious activity that you have identified. The FBI’s Suspicious\nActivity Reporting (SAR) tip line (https://tips.fbi.gov/) is an avenue for reporting any\nsuspicious activities.\nSigns exhibited by potential terrorists (often in this order) include:\n• Surveillance: The targeted area is being watched and studied carefully. This\nmay include recording or monitoring activities.\n• Elicitation: Information is gathered that is specific to the intended target. This\nmay be by mail, phone, or in person.\n• Tests of Security: Local security measures are tested and analyzed, including\nmeasuring reaction times to security breaches or attempts to penetrate security.\n• Funding: Raising, transferring, and spending money, which may include selling\ndrugs or stolen merchandise, human trafficking, and funneling money through\nbusinesses or charities.\n• Acquiring Supplies: Necessary supplies are gathered to prepare the attack,\nincluding weapons/weapon components, transportation, and communications.\nSupplies may be purchased with cash only.\n• Impersonation or Suspicious People Who Do Not Belong: People\nimpersonating roles to gain access or information and people who don’t fit in or\ndon’t seem to belong in the location.\n• Rehearsal and Dry Runs: Groups or individuals will often map out routes,\ndetermine traffic flow and timing ahead of time, and can also operate test runs\nbefore the actual attack.\n• Deployment: The final and most urgent phase when terrorists are deploying\nassets and getting into position. Attack is imminent.\nAlthough it is not the mission of CERT volunteers to keep constant watch for these\nsigns, everyone should be alert to changes in their environment as a clue to a possible\nterrorist attack and report suspicious activities to appropriate authorities.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-5"

Terrorists have frequently\nselected soft targets like schools, parks, large gathering spaces, cafés, and concert\nhalls. Although differently motivated, active shooters in the United States have also\nselected less secure targets like malls, movie theatres, and universities. Smaller, less\ninvolved plots still generate high casualties and allow the attackers to achieve their\nobjectives with fewer resources.\nPreparedness\nTerrorist attacks frequently occur without warning; however, being alert, reporting\nsuspicious activities, and taking general preparedness steps, such as having a plan to\ncommunicate with loved ones, will help you if one does occur. If you believe a terrorist\nattack is imminent, call 9-1-1 and follow the instructions provided.\nExercise 8.1: Preparing for a Terrorism-Related Event\nPurpose: As with all types of disasters and emergencies, preparation is key to planning\nfor a terrorism-related event. Although it is often difficult to predict when such an event\nmay occur, there are several steps that you can take today to be prepared.\nInstructions:\n1. Break into small table groups.\n2.

Remember that\ncustomers and clients are likely to follow the lead of employees and managers during\nan active shooter situation.\n1. RUN\nIf there is an accessible escape path, attempt to evacuate the premises. Be sure to:\n• Have an escape route and plan in mind ahead of time;\n• Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow;\n• Leave your belongings behind;\n• Help others escape, if possible;\n• Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be, if\npossible;\n• Keep your hands visible;\n• Follow the instructions of any police officers; and\n• Call 9-1-1 when you are safe.\n2. HIDE\nIf evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less\nlikely to find you. Your hiding place should:\n• Be out of the active shooter’s view;\n• Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., an office with a\nclosed and locked door); and\n• Not trap you or restrict your options for movement.\nTo prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place:\n• Lock the door; and\n• Blockade the door with heavy furniture.\nIf the active shooter is nearby:\n• Lock the door;\n• Silence your cell phone and/or pager;\n• Turn off any source of noise (e.g., radios, televisions);\n• Hide behind large items (e.g., cabinets, desks); and\n• Remain quiet.\nIf evacuation and hiding out are not possible:\n• Remain calm;\n• Dial 9 -1-1, if possible, to alert police to the active shooter’s location; and\n• If you cannot speak, leave the line open and allow the dispatcher to listen.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-7"

FIGHT\nIf you are unable to run, evacuate or hide and when your life is in imminent danger,\nyou may attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter by:\n• Taking decisive action;\n• Acting as aggressively as possible against him/her;\n• Throwing items and improvising weapons;\n• Yelling; and\n• Committing to your actions.\nHow to Respond When Law Enforcement Arrives\nLaw enforcement’s purpose is to stop the active shooter as soon as possible. Officers\nwill proceed directly to the shooting without stopping to render aid to the survivors.\n• Officers may arrive in teams;\n• Officers may wear street clothes, regular patrol uniforms, or external bulletproof\nvests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment;\n• Officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, and/or handguns; and\n• Officers may shout commands and may push individuals to the ground for their\nsafety.\nHow to react when law enforcement arrives:\n• Try to remain calm;\n• Follow officers’ instructions;\n• Put down any items in your hands (e.g., bags, jackets);\n• Immediately raise hands and spread fingers;\n• Keep hands visible at all times;\n• Avoid making quick movements toward officers such as holding on to them;\n• Avoid pointing, screaming, and/or yelling; and\n• Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating, just proceed in\nthe direction from which officers are entering the premises.\nInformation to provide to law enforcement or 9-1-1 operator:\n• Location of the active shooter(s);\n• Number of shooters, if more than one;\n• Physical description of shooter(s);\n• Number and type of weapons held by the shooter(s); and\n• Number of potential targets at the location.\nThe first officers to arrive to the scene will not stop to help injured persons.

CERT\nvolunteers should in no way activate or respond to an incident in their community.\nHowever, while highly unlikely, it is possible that you may find yourself in a situation that\nyou believe to be a terrorist attack. In this rare circumstance, CERT volunteers have a\ndeveloped skillset to provide care until help arrives.\nLike in any other situation, volunteers should follow the direction of law enforcement and\nfirst responders. You should be mindful of your limits and recognize that your safety is\nyour top priority. Stay safe. Do not put yourself at risk but save lives if you can.\nIf you are willing and able to assist, remember the most important life-saving\ninterventions, recognize what the stress of the situation can do to you, and understand\nthe physical impact of being in a potential terrorist situation.\nTreating Others\nIf you believe you are able to help those around you, focus on the lifesaving\ninterventions that were covered in Unit 3.\n• Stop Bleeding: The average person has approximately five liters of blood.\nSevere blood loss can result in irreversible shock. This means that if you lose\nabout half of your body’s blood supply, no matter what anyone does to try to save\nyou, death is unavoidable. You must get bleeding under control as soon as\npossible. The first way to control severe bleeding is through applying direct\npressure. For more information on controlling bleeding, please refer to page 3-4\nof the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Maintain Body Temperature: It is important to maintain the patient’s body\ntemperature. If necessary, place a blanket or other material under and/or over\nthe patient to provide protection from extreme ground temperatures (hot or cold).\nPeople with very serious injuries are more susceptible to hypothermia, which can\nincrease the risk of death. For more information on maintaining body\ntemperature, please refer to page 3-5 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Opening the Airway: Positioning an injured patient to keep their airway open\nand clear is critical to saving their life. The best position for the body is one in\nwhich the chest can expand fully and the airway is not at risk of being obstructed.\nIn other words, the best position is one in which the tongue cannot flop back into\nthe individual’s throat and one in which blood or fluid does not end up in the\nlungs (aspirated), particularly in the case with someone with facial trauma. There\nare different ways to position an injured patient to keep their airway open\ndepending on if the patient is conscious or unconscious. For more information on\nopening the airway, please refer to page 3-7 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Providing Comfort: CERT volunteers can be of great value to injured and\nemotional patient simply by offering comfort and support. No special skills are\nneeded—just a calm and reassuring presence. For more information on providing\ncomfort, please refer to page 3-9 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-10"

In any life-threatening situation, you will feel fear and this fear\nwill impact your mind and body. It is important for you to be aware of what may happen,\nso you can recognize these responses as a normal part of your body’s response to\nstress. It is normal to experience certain physical and psychological changes.\nRecognize that:\n• Fear is typically at its peak once we comprehend the danger of the situation;\n• Fear has profound effects on the mind and body; and\n• Fear can influence action.\nPhysical Impact\nExplosions create a high-pressure blast that sends debris flying and lifts people off the\nground. The type of injuries and the number of people hurt will vary depending on: the\nphysical environment and the size of the blast, the amount of shielding between people\nand the blast, fires or structural damage that result from the explosion, and whether the\nexplosion occurs in a closed space or an open area. Injuries common to explosions\ninclude:\n• Overpressure damage to the lungs, ears, abdomen, and other pressure sensitive\norgans. Blast lung injury, a condition caused by the extreme pressure of an\nexplosion, is the leading cause of illness and death for initial survivors of an\nexplosion.\n• Fragmentation injuries caused by projectiles thrown by the blast—material from\nthe bomb, shrapnel, or flying debris that penetrates the body and causes\ndamage.\n• Impact injuries are caused when the blast throws a person into another object\ncausing serious injuries, including fractures, amputation, and trauma to the head\nand neck.\n• Thermal injuries caused by burns to the skin, mouth, sinuses, and lungs.\n• Other injuries including exposure to toxic substances, crush injuries, and\naggravation of pre-existing conditions (e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure).\nRemember life-saving interventions for controlling bleeding, maintaining body\ntemperature, and opening airways that were taught in Unit 3: Disaster Medical\nOperations Part 1.\nSecondary Attacks\nTerrorist attacks, especially those involving explosives, may include a secondary wave\ntargeting those who are providing care to the injured.

The Warm Zone in a decontamination situation would be upwind (and upstream\nif the contaminant is waterborne) from the Hot Zone and is used to isolate\nsurvivors during decontamination. In a non-decontamination situation, such as a\nterrorist attack, the warm zone will be the area immediately outside of the\nincident scene.\n3. The Cold Zone is located beyond the Warm Zone.

However, there are some basic guidelines that can be noted for\nthese types of incidents.\nBasic HAZMAT Decontamination Procedures\nThe objective of decontamination is to remove harmful chemicals or particles of\nradioactive dirt or dust that have come in contact with the skin or clothes.\n• Leave the contaminated area immediately. Depending on the circumstances, go\ninside, go outside, or go upwind, uphill, or upstream from the contaminant. (Seek\na distance of at least 1,000 to 1,500 feet.)\n• Take decontamination action. Seconds count! The goal is to limit the time that\nthe agent is in contact with the skin.\n― Remove everything from the body, including jewelry. Cut off clothing that\nwould normally be removed over the head to reduce the probability of\ninhaling or ingesting the agent. Seal your clothes in a plastic bag.\n― Wash hands before using them to shower. If no shower is available,\nimprovise with water from faucets or bottled water.\n― Flush the entire body, including the eyes, underarms, and groin area, with\ncopious amounts of cool water. Hot water opens the pores of the skin and\ncan promote absorption of the contaminant. Using copious amounts of\nwater is important because some chemicals react to small amounts of\nwater.\nIf soap is immediately available, mix the soap with water for decontamination. Avoid\nscrubbing with soap because scrubbing can rub the chemical into the skin rather than\nremove it.\nWash hair with soap or shampoo or rinse with water if soap is not available. Do not use\nconditioner as that can bind radioactive materials to your hair and make it difficult to\nremove.\nIf hosing someone else off or pouring water from a container, avoid both physical\ncontact with the person and with the runoff.\nThe water used for decontamination must be contained and covered or drained outside\nof the shelter area to avoid shelter contamination.\nBlot dry using an absorbent cloth. Do not rub the skin! Put on clean clothes.\nAs soon as possible, emergency responders will set up mass decontamination\ncapabilities. For radiological events, stations for radiation monitoring and blood tests will\nalso be set up to determine levels of exposure and what next steps to take to protect\nhealth.\nCBRNE\nCBRNE stands for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive.\nThese events have the capability to cause mass casualties and cause great public\nAugust 2019 Page 8-13"

The threat of CBRNE attacks has become less\nlikely as terrorists have moved on to new tactics, as discussed earlier in this unit.\nA CBRNE incident differs from a hazardous material incident in both scope (i.e.,\nCBRNE can be a mass casualty situation) and intent. CBRNE incidents are responded\nto under the assumption that they are intentional and malicious.\nCBRNE Indicators\nIt is important to be alert to changes in the environment as a clue to a possible terrorist\nattack.\nWhile bombs and explosions have obvious immediate effects, biological or chemical\nattacks may not be as immediately noticeable. Indicators that a biological or chemical\nattack has occurred or is underway could include:\n• Vapor clouds or mists that are unusual for the area or for the time of day.\n• Out of place and unattended packages, boxes, or vehicles. Items that are out of\nplace and unattended could signal a possible terrorist attack. This could include\nchemical or biological agents as well as explosives.\nIf you observe any of these indicators of a terrorist incident, you should:\n• Not touch it;\n• Move away from the object or area; and\n• Report it to authorities immediately.\nNuclear Attack\nA nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear\nreaction. All nuclear devices cause deadly effects when exploded, including blinding\nlight, intense heat, initial nuclear radiation, blast, fires started by the heat pulse,\nsecondary fires caused by the destruction, and widespread radioactive material that can\ncontaminate the air, water, and ground surfaces for miles around.\nA nuclear device can range from a weapon carried by an intercontinental ballistic\nmissile launched by a hostile nation or terrorist organization, to a small portable nuclear\ndevice transported by an individual.\nIn the very unlikely event you believe you are in a nuclear attack or exposed to\nradiation, there are three factors that significantly affect your safety after the incident:\ntime, distance, and shielding. A critical protective action in a radiological or nuclear\nevent is to get inside as quickly as possible, stay inside, and stay tuned to local radio or\ntelevision stations for further guidance.\n• Stay Inside (time): Limiting the amount of time in the area of an incident is\nimportant to limit exposure to radioactive fallout resulting from the explosion.\nRemain inside until you receive notification from authorities that it is safe to leave\nthe building. In most cases, be prepared to shelter inside for a few days.\nHowever, sheltering may be necessary for as long as a month.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-14"

Get inside as\nsoon as possible and go to the farthest interior room or to a basement. Flat roofs\ncollect fallout particles, so the top floor is not a good choice, nor is a floor\nadjacent to a neighboring flat roof. The more distance between you and the\nfallout particles, the better.\nIf you are outside when the event occurs, do not look at the flash or fire ball. It can blind\nyou. Take cover behind anything that will offer protection, lie flat, and cover your head. If\nthe explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast\nwave to hit. Get inside as soon as you can.\nShelter-in-Place\nYou may receive direction from law enforcement to shelter-in-place. Depending on the\nnature of the threat (if it is chemical or biological), this may involve sealing yourself into\na room. Procedures for sheltering in place during a chemical or biological attack include:\n• Shut off the ventilation system and latch all doors and windows to reduce airflow\nfrom the outside.\n• Go to your shelter-in-place room (where your precut plastic, duct tape, radio, and\nother supplies should be stored).\n• Use precut plastic sheeting to cover openings where air can enter the room,\nincluding doors, windows, vents, electrical outlets, and telephone outlets. When\ncut, the sheeting should extend several inches beyond the dimensions of the\ndoor or window to allow room to duct tape the sheeting to the walls and floor.\n• Tape the plastic sheeting around all doors and windows using duct tape to\nensure a good seal.\n• Seal with duct tape other areas where air can come in, such as under doors and\nareas where pipes enter the home. Air can be blocked by placing towels or other\nsoft objects in areas where air could enter, then securing them with duct tape.\n• Chemicals used in an attack will be carried on the wind and will dissipate over\ntime. You will generally not need to stay in a sealed room for more than a few\nhours. Monitor Emergency Alert System broadcasts to know when it is safe to\nleave the safe room.\n• After contaminants have cleared, open windows and vents and turn on fans to\nprovide ventilation.\nTo be able to execute these procedures during an actual event, requires that you:\n• Store precut plastic sheeting in your identified shelter-in-place room.\n• Assemble and store food, water, and a battery-operated radio in the shelter-in-\nplace room.\n• Practice sealing the room.\n• Establish shelter-in-place procedures wherever you spend significant amounts of\ntime at home, at work, and/or at school.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-15"

In addition,\nan evolving terrorist tactic is cyberterrorism.\n• An Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill\npeople in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use\nfirearms(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of targets. Active\nshooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate\ndeployment of law enforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate\nharm to survivors.\n• Run, Hide, Fight is the best way to respond if an active shooter is in your vicinity.\n• An IED attack is the use of a “homemade” bomb and/or destructive device to\ndestroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. Because they are improvised, IEDs can\ncome in many forms, ranging from a small pipe bomb to a sophisticated device\ncapable of causing massive damage and loss of life.\n• CERT volunteers, along with the public, play a critical role in identifying\nsuspicious activities occurring within the community. There are typically eight\nsigns of terrorism that signal potential terrorist activity. If identified and\ncommunicated correctly to local law enforcement, suspicious activities\nsurrounding the potential possibility of a terrorist attack can be stopped. The\neight signs of terrorism are:\n― Surveillance;\n― Elicitation;\n― Tests of security;\n― Funding;\n― Acquiring supplies;\n― Impersonation or suspicious people who don’t belong;\n― Rehearsal and dry runs; and\n― Deployment.\n• Terrorist attacks frequently occur without warning; however, being alert, reporting\nsuspicious activities, and taking general preparedness steps, such as having a\nplan to communicate with loved ones, will help you if one does occur.

Like in any other situation, be mindful of your\nlimits and recognize that your safety is your top priority. Stay safe. Do not put\nyourself at risk but save lives if you can.\n• It is important to be alert to changes in the environment as a clue to possible\nCBRNE attack.\n― Vapor clouds or mists that are unusual for the area or for the time of day.\n― Out of place and unattended packages, boxes, or vehicles. Items that are\nout of place and unattended could signal a possible terrorist attack. This\ncould include chemical or biological agents as well as explosives.\n• If you observe any of these indicators:\n― Do not touch it;\n― Move away from the area; and\n― Report it to authorities immediately.\nHomework Assignment\nReview the materials to be presented in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-18"

      "title": "HISTORY OF THE CERT BASIC TRAINING",
      "content": "The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program is a nationally\nsupported, locally implemented initiative that teaches people how to better prepare\nthemselves for hazards that may affect their communities. CERT trains them in basic\ndisaster response skills such as team organization, disaster medical operations, fire\nsafety, and light search and rescue. Local CERT programs train and organize teams of\nvolunteers to assist their families, neighbors, co-workers, and other community\nmembers during emergencies when professional responders may not be immediately\navailable to provide assistance. Before, during, and after disasters, CERT volunteer\nteams perform basic response activities, including checking in on neighbors, distributing\ninformation to the public, supporting emergency operations centers, and helping to\nmanage traffic and crowds. The ability for CERT volunteers to perform these activities\nfrees up professional responders to focus their efforts on more complex, essential, and\ncritical tasks. CERT volunteers also support their communities by organizing, promoting,\nand participating in emergency preparedness events, activities, and projects.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) developed the CERT program after\nexamining the civilian response to disasters in Mexico and Japan in 1985. The LAFD\nrecognized that citizens are likely to be on their own during the early stages of disaster.\nUnder these circumstances, family members, co-workers, and neighbors will often\nspontaneously come to the aid of each other. While untrained volunteers can be very\neffective in aiding others, their lack of training puts them at risk for injury or death. For\nexample, during the response to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that claimed more\nthan 10,000 lives, untrained volunteers saved 700 lives, but unfortunately, 100\nvolunteers died in the process.\nIn response, the LAFD decided to develop and offer disaster response training to Los\nAngeles residents so that during and after future disasters volunteers would be able to\nassist in a safe, responsible, and effective manner. The LAFD piloted the first CERT\ntraining in 1986. In turn, other fire departments around the country, including\ncommunities where the major threat is hurricanes rather than earthquakes, adopted the\nLAFD’s training model. Building on this development, the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) expanded the CERT materials in 1994 to make them\napplicable to all hazards and made the program available to communities nationwide.\nSince that time, thousands of dedicated trainers, organizations, and citizens have\nembraced the responsibility to learn new skills and become prepared to execute safe\nand effective emergency response capabilities.\nThe National CERT Program Office would like to thank the regional, state, and local\npartners and subject matter experts who contributed to the 2019 CERT Basic Training\nupdate.\nAugust 2019 Page 1\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual",

      "title": "A MODEL FOR COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS",
      "content": "The CERT program is critical in the effort to engage everyone in the United States in\nmaking their communities safer, more prepared, and more resilient when incidents\noccur.\nCommunity-based preparedness planning allows us all to prepare for and respond to\nanticipated disruptions and potential hazards following a disaster. As individuals, we can\nprepare our homes and families to cope during that critical period. Through pre-event\nplanning, neighborhoods, and worksites can also work together to help reduce injuries,\nloss of lives, and property damage. Neighborhood preparedness will enhance the ability\nof individuals and communities to reduce their emergency needs and to manage their\nexisting resources until professional assistance becomes available.\nStudies of behavior following disasters have shown that groups working together in the\ndisaster period perform more effectively if there has been prior planning and training for\ndisaster response. These studies also show that organized grassroots efforts may be\nmore successful if they are woven into the social and political fabric of the community—\nneighborhood associations, schools, workplaces, places of worship, and other existing\norganizations.\nEffective response, therefore, requires comprehensive planning and coordination of all\nwho will be involved—government, volunteer groups, private businesses, schools, and\ncommunity organizations. With training and information, individuals and community\ngroups can be prepared to serve as a crucial resource capable of performing many of\nthe emergency functions needed in the immediate post-disaster period. The CERT\nprogram trains individuals to be assets to help communities prepare for effective\ndisaster response.\nWhen Disaster Strikes\nThe damage caused by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes,\nand floods, or from manmade/technological events such as explosions or hazardous\nmaterials accidents can affect all aspects of a community, from government services to\nprivate enterprise to civic activities. These events:\n• Severely restrict or overwhelm our response resources, communications,\ntransportation, and utilities; and\n• Leave many individuals and neighborhoods cut off from outside support.\nDamaged roads and disrupted communications systems may restrict the access of\nemergency response agencies into critically affected areas. Thus, for the initial period\nimmediately following a disaster—often up to three days or longer—individuals,\nhouseholds, and neighborhoods may need to rely on their own resources for:\n• Food;\n• Water; and\n• Shelter.\nIndividual preparedness, planning, survival skills, and mutual aid within neighborhoods\nand worksites during this initial period are essential measures in managing the\nAugust 2019 Page 2\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\naftermath of a disaster. What you do today will have a critical impact on the quality of\nyour survival and your ability to help others safely and effectively. You will be more\nresilient to a potentially disruptive event by learning about the likely hazards in your\ncommunity and your community’s plans and protocols, understanding hazard-specific\nprotective actions and response skills, assembling important emergency supplies, and\nmitigating potential hazards in your home. Subsequently, you will be an important asset\nto your family, neighbors, and other members of your community.\nHow CERTS Operate\nAs each CERT is organized and trained in accordance with standard operating\nprocedures developed by the sponsoring agency, members identify potential meeting\nlocations or staging areas to be used in the event of a disaster.\nThe staging area is where the fire department and other services will interact with\nCERTs. Having a centralized contact point makes it possible to communicate damage\nassessments and allocate volunteer resources more effectively. This is true for all\nCERTs, whether active in a neighborhood, workplace, school, college/university\ncampus, or other venue.\nDamage from disasters may vary considerably from one location to another. In an\nactual disaster, communities will deploy CERTs as needs dictate. Volunteers should\nassess their own needs and the priorities of those in their immediate environment first.\nCERT volunteers who do not encounter a need in their immediate area should then\nreport to their staging area, and the first volunteer to arrive will become the initial Team\nLeader (TL) for the disaster response. The TL may pass leadership to someone else as\nother volunteers arrive. Volunteers who find themselves in a heavily impacted location\nshould send runners to staging areas to get assistance from available resources.\nVolunteers may use ham radios or similar technologies to increase communication\ncapabilities and coordination.\nCERTs provide an effective first-response capability. Acting as individuals first, then as\nteam members, trained CERT volunteers can fan-out within their assigned areas,\nextinguish small fires, turn off natural gas at damaged homes, perform light search and\nrescue, and render basic medical treatment. CERTs also act as effective “eyes and\nears” for uniformed emergency responders. Trained volunteers also offer an important\npotential workforce to service organizations in non-hazardous functions such as shelter\nsupport, crowd control, and evacuation.\nAbout the CERT Basic Training\nIf available, emergency services personnel are the best trained and equipped to handle\nemergencies. Following a catastrophic disaster, however, you and your community may\nbe isolated for an extended period for a myriad of reasons, including the size of the area\naffected, inoperable communications systems, or unpassable roads.\nCERT Basic Training prepares you to help yourself and help others in the event of a\ncatastrophic disaster. Because emergency services personnel will not be able to help\neveryone immediately, you can make a difference by using your CERT training to save\nlives and protect property.\nAugust 2019 Page 3\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual\nThis training covers basic skills that are important to know in a disaster when\nemergency services are not available. With training and practice, and by working as a\nteam, you will be able to protect yourself and maximize your capability to help for the\ngreatest number of people after a disaster.\nAugust 2019 Page 4\n\n\nCERT Basic Training Introduction and Overview Participant Manual",

UNIT 1 OVERVIEW\nSetting the Stage\nThe damage caused by natural disasters and manmade events can be extensive. While\nemergency services personnel are the best trained and equipped to handle\nemergencies, they may not be immediately available following a disaster. In such a\nsituation, volunteers of the community may be on their own for several days or longer.\nThey may have to rely on their own resources for food, water, first aid, and shelter.\nAdditionally, neighbors or coworkers may have to provide immediate assistance to\nthose who are hurt or need help.\nCommunity Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) respond in the period immediately\nafter a disaster when response resources are overwhelmed or delayed.\nCERTs are able to:\n• Assist emergency services personnel when requested in accordance with\nstandard operating procedures (SOPs) developed by the sponsoring agency and\nby area of training;\n• Assume some of the same functions as emergency services personnel following\na disaster; and\n• Prepare families and communities prior to emergencies and assist neighbors\nduring an emergency when first responders are not immediately available.\nWhile CERTs are a valuable asset in emergency response, CERTs are not trained to\nperform all of the functions to respond to the same degree as professional responders.\nCERTs are a bridge to professional responders until they are able to arrive. This training\ncovers basic skills that are important to know in a disaster when emergency services\npersonnel are not immediately available.",

      "content": "Community preparedness is a key priority in lessening the impact of disasters. It is\ncritical that all community members take steps to prepare in advance of an event.\nEffective community preparedness addresses the unique attributes of the community:\n• The threat and hazards profile and vulnerabilities of the area;\n• The existing infrastructure;\n• Resources and skills within the community; and\n• The population composition of the community.\nEffective community preparedness also engages the whole community, which includes:\n• Government leaders and the public sector;\n• Community leaders from the private and civic sectors; and\n• The public, including volunteer groups, faith-based groups, and tribal\ncommunities.\nGovernment\nGovernment has the responsibility to develop, test, and refine emergency operations\nplans; ensure emergency responders have adequate skills and resources; and provide\nservices to protect and assist its citizens. In meeting these challenges, government also\nhas the responsibility to involve the community in the planning process, to incorporate\ncommunity resources in the plans, to provide reliable, actionable information, and to\nencourage training, practicing, and volunteer programs.\nGovernment emergency service providers include professionals from the following\nfields:\n• Emergency management;\n• Emergency medical services;\n• Fire and rescue;\n• Human services;\n• Law enforcement;\n• Public health services; and\n• Public works.\nThe Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)\nAll government agencies with a role in disaster response work to organize and\ncoordinate their agencies’ activities before an emergency or disaster. The product of\ntheir work is the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for that community.\nThe EOP is a document that:\n• Assigns responsibility to organizations and individuals for carrying out specific\nactions at projected times and places in an emergency that exceeds the\ncapability or routine responsibility of any one agency (e.g., the fire department);\nAugust 2019 Page 1-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\n• Sets forth lines of authority and organizational relationships and shows how all\nactions will be coordinated;\n• Describes how to protect people and property in emergencies and disasters; and\n• Identifies personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies, and other resources\navailable—within the jurisdiction or by agreement with other jurisdictions—for use\nduring response and recovery operations.\nIn short, the EOP describes how the community will function in an emergency.\nCommunity Leaders\nCommunity leaders from the private and civic sectors have a responsibility to participate\nin community preparedness. Their responsibilities include:\n• Participating on the local collaborative planning council to provide insights and\nperspectives reflecting their industry or the constituency they service. For\nexample, people with disabilities, local schools, communities with language or\ncultural differences, small businesses, the economically disadvantaged, and\ncommunities of faith;\n• Identifying and integrating appropriate resources into government plans; and\n• Ensuring facilities, staff, and customers or population served are prepared,\ntrained, and practiced in preparedness actions.\nThe Public\nThe public also has a responsibility for preparedness. All members of the community\nshould:\n• Learn about the community alerts and warnings, evacuation routes, and how to\nget critical information;\n• Take training in preparedness, first aid, and response skills;\n• Practice skills and personal plans through periodic drills in multiple settings;\n• Network and be able to help others;\n• Participate in community feedback opportunities;\n• Report suspicious activity; and\n• Volunteer.\nEngaging the Whole Community\nFEMA’s Whole Community approach to emergency management seeks to engage the\nfull capacity of society in a dialogue to increase disaster preparedness and resilience.\nThe full capacity of society is a reference to all of the partners within a community who\nshould engage in community preparedness, including government entities; non-\ngovernmental organizations; faith-based organizations; schools; nonprofit groups;\nprivate sector entities; and at the grass roots level, individuals, families, local\ncommunities, and social networks.\nCommunity coalitions organized collaborative bodies within a community such as\nCitizen Corps help to foster and strengthen relationships throughout the community.\nRelationships are the fabric that makes a community stronger and more resilient after\nAugust 2019 Page 1-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\ndisasters. Social capital is the value we place on our relationships with one another.\nStudies have shown that communities that possess a high amount of social capital\nbounce back much more efficiently after a disaster and tend to rely less on outside\nresources to return to normal.\nDespite advances in technology, a functioning community is based on complex and\ninterdependent systems driven by human forces. Community coalitions bring\ngovernment and community leaders together to ensure emergency plans more\neffectively reflect the community’s needs, challenges, capabilities, and resources.\nGet Involved\nPreparedness requires active participation from all. Below are some steps to get\ninvolved.\n• Start the process by talking to your friends and family about the hazards in your\narea and discuss what steps—large or small—you all need to take to be able to\nhelp each other in a crisis.\n• Ask about emergency planning at your workplace, schools, places of worship,\nand other social settings.\n• Make sure those individuals in charge have a plan and are connected to\ncommunity authorities on emergency management and planning.\n• Take training to acquire the skills you need to help others and keep your skills\ncurrent through refresher training and practice.\n• Participate in the CERT program to provide training, practice, and the connection\nwith others to develop teams.\n• Plan to participate in drills and exercises with your family and neighbors and at\nyour workplace, school, place of worship, and community-organized events. The\nmore you practice, the better prepared you will be to take effective action when a\ndisaster happens.\n• Talk to your friends and family about volunteering. Volunteering to help your\ncommunity through CERT and other activities is a great experience to share!\nAugust 2019 Page 1-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: HAZARDS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT\nTypes of Disasters\nDisasters can be:\n• Natural (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, floods, extreme heat, hurricanes, landslides,\nthunderstorms, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, winter storms);\n• Technological and Accidental (e.g., hazardous material spill, nuclear power plant\naccident);\n• Terrorism (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive weapons);\n• Pandemics; and\n• Home Fires.\nCERT volunteers will generally respond to large-scale events in their communities. The\nscope of this CERT training does not cover pandemics. While home fires are not always\ncommunity events, Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls, does discuss them. For the\npurposes of this training, most of the hazards discussed will be natural, technological\nand accidental, or terrorism related.\nKey Elements of Disasters\nRegardless of the event, disasters have several key elements in common.\n• They are relatively unexpected, with the little or no warning or opportunity to\nprepare.\n• Increased demands for resources may initially overwhelm available response\npersonnel and emergency services.\n• They endanger lives, health, and the environment.\nIn the immediate aftermath of a disaster, needs are often greater than professional\nemergency services personnel can provide. In these instances, CERTs become a vital\nlink in the emergency service chain.\nUnderstanding Local Hazard Vulnerability\nAssessing your community’s vulnerability to hazards allows the community to prioritize\npreparedness measures and to target effective actions for the appropriate hazard. To\nassess your community’s vulnerability to hazards, it is useful to:\n• Identify the most common disasters that occur;\n• Identify possible hazards with most severe impact;\n• Consider recent and/or historical impacts;\n• Identify susceptible locations in the community for specific hazards—people,\nbuildings, infrastructure; and\n• Consider what to expect for disruption of services and length of restoration.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nImpact on Infrastructure\nInfrastructure and essential service providers that enable our communities to thrive and\ngrow have become increasingly interconnected. Impacts in one area often affect\nessential government services, businesses, and individuals in an entire region with far-\nreaching health, safety, economic, and environmental consequences (see Table 1.1).\nTable 1.1: Examples of Possible Impact on Infrastructure\nInfrastructure at Risk Possible Impacts\n• Roads are closed and/or impassable\n• Responders may be delayed in reaching areas of\nTransportation need\n• Flow of needed supplies (e.g., food, water) is\ninterrupted\n• Damaged critical facilities (e.g., hospitals, fire stations,\nStructures police precincts, airports) unable to function\n• Increased risk of damage from falling debris\n• Survivors unable to phone for help or reach service\nproviders\nCommunications Systems\n• Coordination of services is hampered\n• Families and friends cannot communicate\n• Loss of service\nUtilities • Increased risk of fire or electrical shock\n• Limited access to fuel (e.g., pumps that may not work)\n• Medical facilities hampered\n• Inadequate water flow, which results in notice to boil\nWater Service\nwater and hampered firefighting capabilities\n• Increased risk to public health\n• Increased risk of fire or explosion from fuel line\nFuel Supplies rupture\n• Flow of fuel is interrupted by impassable roads\n• ATMs do not work\nFinancial Services\n• Credit card systems inoperable\nConsequences of Damage to Infrastructure\nEach instance of damage to infrastructure may severely restrict the abilities of police,\nfire, and emergency medical services in that disaster. During a disaster, hospital\nemergency room personnel prioritize resources based on the severity of each injury. For\nemergency room personnel, life-threatening injuries take the highest priority and they\nAugust 2019 Page 1-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\ntreat them first. In the same way, during or after a disaster, emergency services\npersonnel must prioritize resources according to the highest-priority need.\n• Police will address incidents of grave public safety.\n• Firefighters will suppress major fires.\n• EMS personnel will handle life-threatening injuries. You should be aware,\nhowever, that CERTs may also handle life-threatening injuries until EMS units\nbecome available.\n• Lower-priority needs will be met in other ways.\nDamage Related to Structure Type\nIt is important to know what type of damage to expect from the main types of structures\nin the community. Engineered buildings, such as most high-rise buildings, have\nperformed well in most types of disasters. During earthquakes, flooding events (e.g.,\nhurricanes, tsunamis), and high-wind events (e.g., tornadoes, hurricanes), older high-\nrise buildings, however, are more susceptible to damage from:\n• Broken glass;\n• Falling panels; and\n• Collapsing walkways and stairways.\nKeep in mind that age, type of construction, and type of disaster are major factors in\npotential damage to detached homes and garages.\n• Tornado and hurricane damage to single-family homes can range from little\ndamage to total destruction.\n• In general, homes built prior to 1940 were not originally bolted to the foundation,\nmaking them subject to being shaken, blown, or floated off their foundations.\n• Older homes constructed of non-reinforced brick are less stable than newer\nconstruction.\n• When an event damages a structure, there is a threat of additional damage, such\nas fire from ruptured gas lines, following the event.\n• Mobile homes are most susceptible to damage because they can be displaced.\nWhen displacement occurs, structural integrity becomes questionable and utility\nconnections may be damaged, increasing the risk of fire and electric shock.\nIn multiple-unit dwellings, there is often a main utility shutoff for the entire building, as\nwell as a shutoff located within each individual unit. Depending on the situation at hand,\nyou may need to use one or both. Be mindful of the effects and consequences of using\neach (Unit 6 will cover utility control in more depth).\nMultiple-Use Buildings\nMultiple-use buildings with oversized roof spans have a greater risk of collapse and\nbroken glass in a disaster. These include:\n• Airports;\n• Malls and strip malls;\n• Places of worship;\n• Sports arenas; and\n• Warehouse-type structures.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nNon-Structural Hazards\nThere is also a risk in all types of structures from fixtures and other items within a home,\ngarage, or workplace, that can pose a hazard during or after a disaster, including:\n• Gas line ruptures from water heaters or ranges displaced by shaking, water, or\nwind;\n• Damage from falling books, dishes, or other cabinet contents;\n• Risk of injury or electric shock from displaced appliances and office equipment;\nand/or\n• Fire from faulty wiring, overloaded plugs, frayed electrical cords.\nReducing hazards is an important part of personal preparedness. It is also important to\nknow how and when to turn off utilities safely. Unit 6 – Fire Safety and Utility Control will\ncover utility shutoffs.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: HOME AND WORKPLACE PREPAREDNESS\nFEMA is committed to social and physical science as the foundation for increasing\nindividual and community preparedness. The agency has conducted national household\nsurveys to assess the public’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on preparing for a\nrange of hazards since 2007. The 2015 National Household Survey included key\nfindings on individual preparedness, and in general, the preparedness concepts relayed\nthroughout the CERT Basic Training.\n• 68 percent of respondents reported having enough supplies to get through three\ndays.\n• 63 percent of respondents reported having taken steps to safeguard critical\ndocuments.\n• 39 percent of respondents reported having sought preparedness information\nwithin the past year.\n• 27 percent of respondents reported having talked to others about getting\nprepared within the past year.\n• 18 percent of respondents reported having attended a preparedness\nmeeting/training within the past year.\nPreparing for a Disaster\nMany preparedness actions are useful in any type of emergency, and some are specific\nto the type of disaster. A critical first step to preparedness is to understand the hazard\nor hazards that are most relevant to your community. Next, it is important to learn about\nlocal alerts and warning systems, evacuation routes, and sheltering plans. It is also\nimportant to familiarize yourself with hazards in other areas given that you may\nexperience a different and less familiar type of hazard when you are traveling.\nRegardless of the type of disaster, important elements of disaster preparedness\ninclude:\n• Having the skills to evaluate the situation quickly and to take effective action to\nprotect yourself;\n• Having a family disaster plan and practicing the plan with drills;\n• Assembling supplies in multiple locations;\n• Reducing the impact of hazards through mitigation practices; and\n• Getting involved by participating in training and volunteer programs.\nIt is always important to address specific needs, including any access or functional\nneeds, considerations for pets and service animals, and transportation requirements for\nyou and your family and friends. More information on preparedness is available online\n(see Table 1.2).\nAugust 2019 Page 1-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nWebsites of Interest\nTable 2.2: Preparedness Websites\nOrganization URL Description\nhttps://www.ready.gov/community- Resources, trainings, and information\nemergency-response-team about the CERT program.\nFEMA’s national website for disaster\npreparedness. Provides excellent,\nwww.ready/gov/\ngeneral advice and is a good place to\nstart.\nPrepareathon is a grassroots\nwww.community.fema.gov campaign to increase community\npreparedness and resilience.\nThe American Red Cross website is\nfull of excellent tips and information\nrelated to most of the natural disasters\nwww.redcross.org\nthat occur, including a few topics not\ncovered at FEMA’s Ready.gov\nwebsite.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) established this\nwww.pandemicflu.gov\nwebsite as a hub for national\ninformation on pandemic influenza.\nFamily Disaster Plan\nIn addition to knowing immediate protective actions that you may need to take, you\nshould also create a family disaster plan. These plans can mean the difference\nbetween life and death in a disaster. Important considerations for your family disaster\nplan include:\n• Where will you meet family members? You should have a location outside the\nhouse and another location outside the neighborhood;\n• Identify an out-of-state “check-in contact;”\n• Plan for all possibilities—extended stay, sheltering in place, or evacuation;\n• How you will escape buildings where you spend time—your home, workplace,\nschool, and place of worship; and\n• What route (and several alternatives) will you use to evacuate?\n• Do you have transportation?\nAugust 2019 Page 1-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nFamily safety is the most important factor when a disaster strikes. To make the most\ninformed decision regarding your family’s safety, you should first consider what option\nis best given the situation. It is also essential to practice your plan with your family—\nsuch as evacuating the home and contacting all family members using your “check-in\ncontact.” Practicing your plan now will improve your performance when it matters most.\nCreating a Family Disaster Plan\nTo get started…\n• Contact your local emergency management office and your local chapter of the\nAmerican Red Cross.\nFind out which disasters are most likely to happen in your community.\n-\nAsk how you would receive warnings about the event.\n-\nFind out how to prepare for each type of disaster.\n-\n• Meet with your family.\nDiscuss the types of disasters that could occur.\n-\nExplain how to prepare and respond.\n-\nDiscuss what to do if advised to evacuate.\n-\nPractice what you have discussed.\n-\n• Plan how your family will stay in contact if separated by a disaster.\nPick two meeting places: 1) a location a safe distance from your home in\n-\ncase of fire and 2) a place outside your neighborhood in case you cannot\nreturn home.\nChoose an out-of-state friend as a “check-in contact” for everyone to call.\n-\n• Make sure the person selected understands that they are your out-\nof-state contact in case of emergency and what you would expect\nof them should such an emergency arise.\n• Give your “check-in contact” person a list of pertinent people to\ncontact. Be sure to include phone numbers!\n• Periodically practice using your local and out-of-state contacts as if\nit were an emergency.\nPrepare a business-card size list of family and friends’ phone numbers\n-\nand print one for each family member.\n• FEMA developed the Family Communications Plan to consolidate\nimportant contact information for emergencies. The two-page plan\nincludes double-sided card printouts you can use for this purpose.\n• As a security measure, do not specify relationships.\n• Complete the following steps:\nPost emergency telephone numbers by every home phone and save in\n-\nevery cell phone.\nShow responsible family members how and when to shut off water, gas,\n-\nand electricity at main switches.\nInstall a smoke alarm on each level of your home, especially near\n-\nbedrooms, and a carbon monoxide alarm in or near every bedroom. Test\nthem monthly and change the batteries when you change your clocks in\nthe spring and fall.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\n• Contact your local fire department to learn about home fire hazards.\n• Learn first aid and CPR.\nContact your local chapter of the American Red Cross, American Heart\n-\nAssociation, or National Safety Council for information and training.\n• Meet with your neighbors.\nPlan how the neighborhood could work together after a disaster; know\n-\nyour neighbors’ skills (e.g., medical, technical) and work with other\ncommunity partners.\nConsider how you could help neighbors, including the elderly or\n-\nindividuals who have access or functional needs.\nMake plans for childcare in case parents cannot get home.\n-\nAssembling and Storing Disaster Supplies\nYou can cope best by preparing for a disaster before it strikes. One way to prepare is to\nassemble disaster supplies in multiple locations. After disaster strikes, you may not\nhave time to shop or search for supplies. If you have gathered supplies in advance, you\nand your family can endure an evacuation or home confinement.\nTo Prepare Your Disaster Supply Kit",

These supplies are listed with an asterisk (*).\nNotes Regarding Your Disaster Supply Kit:\nWater\n• Store water in plastic containers such as soft drink bottles.\n• Look for the triangular recycling symbol with a number 1 on the bottom of the\nbottle, as those are best for water storage. Avoid using containers that will\ndegrade quickly or break, such as milk jugs or glass bottles.\n• Wash the bottle with soap and warm water, fill with water from your tap, and\nstore in a cool, dark area away from direct sunlight.\n• Replace your emergency water every six months by repeating the process as all\nplastic degrades over time.\n• Keep in mind that a normally active person needs to drink at least 2 quarts of\nwater each day. Hot environments and intense physical activity can double that\nrequirement. Children, nursing mothers, and ill people will need more.\n• Store at least 1 gallon of water per person, per day (3 quarts for drinking, 1 quart\nfor food preparation and sanitation).*\nAugust 2019 Page 1-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\n• Keep at least a 3-day supply of water for each person in your household.\nIf you have questions about the quality of the water, purify it before drinking. You can\nheat water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or use commercial purification tablets to purify\nthe water. You can also use regular household liquid chlorine bleach if it is pure 5.25 –\n6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite (see Table 1.3). (Do not use perfumed bleach!) After\nadding bleach, shake or stir the water container and let it stand 30 minutes before\ndrinking.\nTable 3.3: Ratios for Purifying Water with Bleach\nWater Quantity Bleach Added\n1 quart 4 drops\n1 gallon 8 drops\n4 gallons 1/3 teaspoon\n*Note: If water is cloudy, double the recommended amount of bleach.\nFood and Kitchen Items\nStore at least a 3-day supply of nonperishable food. Select foods that require no\nrefrigeration, preparation, or cooking and little or no water. If you must heat food, pack a\ncan of solid gel fuel. Select food items that are compact and lightweight. Avoid salty\nfoods if possible as they increase thirst. Table 1.4 includes a selection of foods to\ninclude in your disaster kit. Check expiration dates biannually.\nFirst Aid Kit*\nAssemble a first aid kit for your home and one for each car.

As part of your escape plan you should:\n• Consider the needs of children and individuals with access and functional needs;\n• Inform all family members or office coworkers of the plan; and\n• Run practice escape drills.\nThe following figure shows an example of an escape plan.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nImage 1.1: Escape Plan\nSample family escape plan with arrows showing an escape route from every room in the home\nand a family meeting place outside the home\nIn most cases, homeowners will not have smoke alarms in every room, but it is\nimportant to have a smoke alarm at least on every level of the house. Practice your\nplans after you develop them. Conduct family fire drills, follow the local evacuation\nroutes, and locate the nearest shelter to ensure that when a disaster occurs, you know\nwhat to do.\nExercise 1.2: Evacuate!\nInstructions: Take the scenario given and decide what things to bring with you and/or\nwhat to do in the time available.\nProtective Actions\nBecause many disasters occur with little or no warning, individuals need to have the\nknowledge and skills to take immediate protective actions in the first critical moments\nafter a disaster has occurred—before you have instruction from authorities. While the\nspecific actions to take are based on a number of variables (e.g., disaster type, amount\nof warning, amount of training you have taken, and location), the following list provides\nan overview of protective actions for which you should be familiar. These should be your\nobjectives in assessing your post-event environment.\n• Assess the situation. When something occurs without notice, it is important to\ntake a few seconds to assess the situation to determine your most effective next\nsteps, including identifying the type of event and determining whether the event\nhas compromised air quality or a building structure.\n• Decide to stay or change locations. In some instances, you should stay where\nyou are (e.g., if you are inside and an event has occurred outside, you may need\nto stay inside) and in other circumstances you should change location (e.g., if\nAugust 2019 Page 1-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nyou are inside and the event is inside, you may need to evacuate the building).\nAll disasters have unique attributes, so it is important for you to realize you may\nneed to evaluate the circumstances to determine the best course of action\n• Staying or changing location is a critical early decision in disasters. If you\nare not in immediate danger, you should stay where you are and get more\ninformation before taking your next steps. Thinking through the likely hazards in\nyour community and where you might be when an event occurs may help you\nvisualize your response. Additionally, consider your own circumstances and\nthose of your household. Elderly persons or individuals with access and\nfunctional needs may need to evacuate well in advance of official notice or before\nthe situation turns dangerous. While you may need to make the first immediate\ndecision to stay inside or go outside or to shelter in place by sealing a room\nwithout authoritative instruction, it is important to listen to local authorities when\nthey provide that information. If experts or local officials tell you to evacuate from\nyour location, LEAVE!\n• Seek clean air and protect breathing passages. Regardless of the type of\ndisaster, clean air is a critical need. Actions to protect your breathing passages\nand to seek clean air may include covering your mouth with a cloth or mask,\nvacating the building, or sheltering in place by sealing an internal room while the\nairborne contaminant dissipates.\n• Protect yourself from debris and signal rescuers if trapped. Protecting\nyourself from falling or precarious debris is an essential protective action. If\ntrapped, protect your airways, bang on an object, or blow a whistle. Yelling\nshould be a last resort.\n• Remove contaminants. If contaminants are released into the area or you\nencounter liquid or solid contaminants, quickly remove contaminated clothing\nbefore washing yourself with soap and water, starting at the head and working\ntoward the feet.\n• Practice good hygiene. Good hygiene is a preventive measure for spreading\ndisease, and it is important to be mindful of hygiene in a post disaster\nenvironment. Clean drinking water and sanitation are important protective\nactions.\nSheltering\nThere are different types of sheltering, and each are appropriate for different disasters.\n• Shelter in place: Sealing a room is a way to protect yourself from contaminants\nin the air for a short period until the contaminants dissipate. You should identify\nan internal room in your home, at work, or other locations where you spend a\ngreat deal of time. If you are required to shelter in place, you will be in this room\nfor only a few hours, but it is important that you be able to seal the room quickly.\nStoring specific items in the room is helpful. You should have snacks and water,\na battery-operated radio, a flashlight, and pre-cut plastic sheeting and duct tape\nto seal off vents and door and window openings.\n• Shelter for extended stay: Sheltering for an extended stay means you would\nstay where you are for several days or, in the case of a pandemic, authorities\nAugust 2019 Page 1-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nmay ask you to limit your time outside the home for up to two weeks. It is\nimportant to store emergency supplies for these possibilities.\n• Mass care/community shelter: These shelters often provide water, food,\nmedicine, and basic sanitary facilities but, if possible, you should take your three-\nday disaster supplies kit with you so that you will be sure to have the supplies\nyou require.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: REDUCING THE IMPACT OF HAZARDS THROUGH\nMITIGATION\nMitigation\nAssembling disaster supplies and having a family disaster plan will help reduce the\nimpact a disaster may have on you and your family. Mitigation is another approach you\ncan take. Mitigation is the reduction of loss of life and property by lessening the impact\nof disasters. Mitigation includes any activities that prevent an emergency, reduce the\nlikelihood of occurrence, or reduce the damaging effects of unavoidable hazards. A few\nexamples include purchasing appropriate insurance and taking structural and\nnonstructural measures.\nYou should ensure your homeowner’s policy provide adequate coverage and covers\nappropriate hazards for your area. Homeowner’s insurance does not cover damage\ncaused by flooding, so it is important to know whether you are in a flood hazard zone. If\nyou are, it is strongly advised to purchase flood insurance. Visit the National Flood\nInsurance Program website, www.Floodsmart.gov, to learn more.\nSome mitigation measures require a bigger investment to address structural changes to\nreduce the impact of disasters (see Table 1.5). Other non-structural mitigation\nmeasures may include relatively simple actions you can take to prevent home\nfurnishings and appliances from causing damage or injuries during any event that might\ncause them to shift.\nTable 5.5: Home Mitigation Measures\nType of Hazard Sample Precautions\n• Bolt older houses to the foundation\n• Install trusses or hurricane straps to reinforce the roof\n• Strap propane tanks and chimneys\nStructural • Strap mobile homes to their concrete pads\n• Raise utilities (above the level of flood risk)\n• Ask a professional to check the foundation, roof connectors,\nchimney, etc.\n• Anchor furniture (e.g., bookshelves, hutches, grandfather\nclocks) to the wall\n• Secure appliances and office equipment in place with\nindustrial strength hook and loop fasteners\n• Secure cabinet doors with childproof fasteners\nNon-Structural • Locate and label shutoffs for gas, electricity, and water\nbefore disasters occur. After a disaster, shut off the utilities\nas needed to prevent fires and other risks\n• Teach all home occupants, including children who are old\nenough to handle the responsibility, when and how to shut\noff the important utilities\nAugust 2019 Page 1-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nType of Hazard Sample Precautions\n• Secure water heaters to the wall to safeguard against\nruptured gas line or loose electrical wires\n• Install hurricane storm shutters to protect windows\nPlease note, a safe room is NOT the same as a shelter-in-place location. A safe room\nrequires significant fortification for the room to provide protection against extremely high\nwinds. More information regarding safe rooms is available at www.fema.gov/safe-\nrooms.\nSheltering-in-place protects you from contaminants in the air. To shelter in place, you do\nnot need to alter the structure of the room. You are simply sealing the room with plastic\nsheeting and duct tape for a short time while the contaminants in the air dissipate.\nFortifying Your Home\nRemember that different non-structural hazards pose different threats, depending on\nthe disaster, as outlined by the following examples.\n• Home Fires\nMake sure that burglar bars and locks on outside window entries are easy\n-\nto open from the inside.\n• Landslides\nInstall flexible pipefittings to avoid gas or water leaks; flexible fittings are\n-\nmore resistant to breakage.\n• Wildfires\nAvoid using wooden shakes and shingles for roofing.\n-\nClear all flammable vegetation at least 30 feet from the home.\n-\nRemove vines from the walls of the home.\n-\nPlace propane tanks at least 30 feet from the home or other structures.\n-\nStack firewood at least 30 feet away and uphill from the home.\n-\nFor more information: “Learn About the Different Types of Disasters and Hazards” at\nwww.fema.gov/hazard/index.shtm.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-22\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 6: CERT DISASTER RESPONSE\nAs described earlier in this unit, CERTs respond in the period immediately after a\ndisaster when response resources are overwhelmed or delayed. CERTs assist\nemergency response personnel when requested in accordance with standard operating\nprocedures developed by the sponsoring agency. Working as a team, members assume\nsome of the same functions as emergency response personnel. As a reminder, while\nCERTs are a valuable asset in emergency response. CERTs are not trained to perform\nall of the functions or respond to the same degree as professional responders. CERTs\nare a bridge to professional responders until they arrive. CERTs respond after a\ndisaster by:\n• Treating life-threatening injuries until professional assistance is available;\n• Helping disaster survivors cope with their emotional stressors;\n• Locating and turning off utilities, if safe to do so;\n• Extinguishing small fires; and\n• Conducting light search and rescue operations.\nThere is a distinction between how a CERT volunteer responds to a disaster as an\nindividual and how that volunteer responds as part of a team. In all instances, it is\ncritical for CERT volunteers to stay within the limits of their training when providing\ndisaster relief.\nA CERT volunteer’s first responsibility is personal and family safety. Only after CERT\nvolunteers have secured their personal and family safety is it possible and pertinent to\nrespond in a group capacity to do what is necessary for the community as a whole.\nThe sponsoring agency orchestrates its group response. In general, the team members\nselect a leader (and alternate) and define the meeting location—or staging area—they\nwill use in the event of disaster.\nCERT volunteers gather at the pre-established staging area to organize and receive\ntasking assignments. Leaders may identify “runners” to serve as a communication link\nbetween the staging area and CERT volunteers working in the field.\nIn some cases, CERT volunteers also provide a well-trained workforce for such duties\nthat entail shelter support, crowd and traffic management, and evacuation. It is\nimportant to note that when you become a CERT volunteer, you do not give up any\nrights you have as United States citizen. You can take the same legally permissible\nactions you would as an individual, but certain restrictions apply when acting as a CERT\nvolunteer. When you put on the green CERT vest, you represent the agency or group\nthat sponsored you.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-23\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nCERT Organization\nThe chart below shows the basic CERT structure, including four sections. No matter\nwhich function CERT volunteers are assigned to, effective CERTs require teamwork.\nThere are checklists in the Additional Materials section at the back of Unit 1 in the\nParticipant Manual that will help in:\n• Planning and organizing a CERT; and\n• Assembling equipment and supplies for a CERT.\nCERT organization will be covered more in-depth in Unit 2: CERT Organization\nImage 1.2: CERT Organization\n• CERT organization showing the government agency liaison at the top.\n• Underneath is the CERT Incident Commander/Team Leader who directs the\nactivities of the four sections: Operations, Planning, Logistics, and\nAdministration.\n• Underneath the Operations section are three response teams: Fire Suppression,\nSearch and Rescue, and Medical.\n• Underneath the Planning section are two sections: Documentation and Incident\nStatus.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-24\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nRemember that, at all times, a CERT volunteer’s first job is to stay safe.\nIt is important to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). CERT\nvolunteers are required to wear the following:\n• Helmet;\n• Goggles;\n• N95 Mask;\n• Gloves (work and non-latex exam); and\n• Sturdy shoes or boots.\nCERT in Action\nAcross the country, CERTs continue to be activated in a wide range of disaster and\nemergency support operations. For these efforts, CERT volunteers and teams are\nreceiving federal, state, and local recognition for their response assistance. For brief\nprofiles on how CERTs have assisted in actual emergencies all over the country visit\nthe national CERT website, www.ready.gov/community-emergencyresponse-team.\nCERTs in Non-Disaster Roles\nCERT volunteers are also a potential volunteer pool for the community. They can help\nwith non-emergency projects such as:\n• Identifying and aiding neighbors and coworkers who might need assistance\nduring an emergency or disaster;\n• Distributing preparedness materials and conducting preparedness\ndemonstrations;\n• Staffing first aid booths and preparedness displays at health fairs, county fairs,\nand other special events;\n• Assisting with the installation of smoke alarms for seniors and special needs\nhouseholds; and\n• Assisting with traffic and crowd management at large community events.\nBy participating in non-emergency community projects, CERT volunteers build\nrecognition for the CERT program within their community and raise overall awareness\nof community preparedness. These events also provide CERT volunteers with valuable\npractice using the Incident Command System and operating with a partner.\nProtection for Disaster Workers\n“Good Samaritan” laws generally protect CERT volunteers who provide care in a\nprudent and reasonable manner.\nThe Volunteer Protection Act (VPA) of 1997 is a Federal law that protects volunteers\nfrom liability as long as they are acting in accordance with the training that they have\nreceived. VPA protects CERT volunteers during a disaster, and volunteers may also\nhave further protection under relevant state statutes where they reside.\nAugust 2019 Page 1-25\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nFor additional information:\nhttps://www.nonprofitrisk.org/app/uploads/2017/01/stateliability-laws.pdf\nTable 1.6: Local Laws in Your Area\nApplicable Laws and Key Points\nApplicable Laws Key Points\nAugust 2019 Page 1-26\n\n\nCERT Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness Participant Manual\nSECTION 7: ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR CERT VOLUNTEERS\nAfter completing initial CERT training, many CERT volunteers seek to expand and\nimprove their skills through continuing CERT modules offered locally, courses offered\nthrough the American Red Cross, or programs from other sources.

On-Scene management in a\ndisaster situation follows these principles:\n• Maintain the safety of disaster workers. The CERT Team Leader (TL) must\ncontinually prioritize response activities based on the team’s capability and\ntraining. TLs also maintain the principle that rescuer safety is the number one\nconcern. CERT functional leadership assigns activities and accounts for team\nvolunteers. CERT volunteers work in the buddy system and respond based on\ntheir size-up of the situations that they encounter.\n• Provide clear leadership and organizational structure by developing a chain of\ncommand and roles that are known by all team volunteers. Each CERT member\nhas only one person that he or she takes direction from and responds to.\n• Improve the effectiveness of rescue efforts. Disaster information is collected, and\nresponses are prioritized based on rescuer safety and doing the greatest good\nfor the greatest number according to the team’s capabilities and training.\nCERT Application of On-Scene Management\nThe specific CERT organizational structure and protocols provide:\n• A well-defined management structure (e.g., leadership, functional areas,\nreporting chain, working in teams);\n• A manageable span of control that provides for a desirable rescuer-to-supervisor\nratio, optimum 5-to-1 with an acceptable spread of 2-to-7;\n• Common terminology that contributes to effective communication and shared\nunderstanding;\n• Effective communication among team volunteers and with professional\nresponders, including the use of radios;\n• Consolidated action plans that coordinate strategic goals, tactical objectives, and\nsupport activities;\n• Comprehensive resource management that facilitates application of available\nresources to the incident in a timely manner; and\n• Accountability.\nObjectives for CERT On-Scene Management\nIn a disaster situation, the CERT TL:\n• Identifies the scope of the incident (e.g., What is the problem?);\n• Determines an overall strategy (e.g., What can we do, and how will we do it?);\n• Deploys teams and resources (e.g., Who is going to do what?); and\n• Documents actions and results.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nThe Need for Flexibility\nDisasters create a dynamic, ever-changing environment. The CERT organizational\nframework is flexible so that it can expand or contract depending on the ongoing\nassessment priorities determined by the CERT Team Leader, people, and resources\navailable. This expansion and contraction help ensure:\n• Rescuer safety;\n• Doing the greatest good for the greatest number;\n• A manageable span of control; and\n• Accountability of CERT volunteers.\nIncident Command System\nThe ICS is the system used by emergency response agencies to manage emergency\noperations. When a CERT activates, it becomes part of that system. This section will\nexplain the ICS format and detail how CERTs both operate within the ICS and organize\nthemselves to replicate that of the ICS structure.\nBasic ICS structure for a CERT is established by the person who arrives first on the\nscene. This person becomes the TL. Initially, the TL may handle all of the command\npositions of the ICS but, as the incident evolves, he or she may assign personnel as\nneeded to the ICS Command Functions:\n• Operations Section Chief;\n• Intelligence/Investigations Section Chief;\n• Planning Section Chief;\n• Logistics Section Chief; and\n• Finance/Administration Section Chief.\nThrough an effective ICS, all CERT volunteers report through a chain of command to\nthe TL. The TL reports to the first fire or law enforcement official at their location and\ntakes direction from that person until otherwise directed or until the CERT is relieved.\nImage 2.1: ICS Command Function Organization Chart\nAugust 2019 Page 2-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nAlthough there are a number of detailed responsibilities under each ICS function, the\nsystem itself is easy to understand. CERTs will typically require the Operations,\nPlanning, and Logistics functions. The CERT Team Leader is responsible for handling\nor delegating each function to team volunteers.\nAs the incident expands, CERT volunteers are assigned or re-assigned to each section\nto handle specific aspects of the response while maintaining an effective span of\ncontrol.\n• CERT Team Leader:\n― Ensures incident safety;\n― Establishes incident objectives;\n― Delegates authority to others;\n― Provides information to internal and external parties;\n― Establishes and maintains liaison with other responders (e.g., fire, law\nenforcement, public works, other CERTs); and\n― Takes direction from agency officials.\n• Intelligence/Investigations Section:\n― Prevents and deters potential unlawful activity, incidents, and/or attacks;\n― Collects, processes, analyzes, secures, and appropriately disseminates\ninformation and intelligence;\n― Conducts investigations; and\n― Informs and supports life safety operations.\nIntelligence/Investigations is a function in the formal Incident Command System;\nhowever, CERTs will have a very limited involvement, if any, with this function.\n• Planning Section:\n― Tracks resource status (e. g., number of CERT volunteers who have\n“reported for duty”);\n― Tracks situation status;\n― Prepares the Team’s action plan;\n― Develops alternative strategies; and\n― Provides documentation services.\n• Logistics Section:\n― Provides communications;\n― Provides food and medical support to Team volunteers;\n― Manages supplies and facilities; and\n― Make sure that there are adequate resources (e.g., personnel, supplies,\nand equipment) for meeting the incident objectives.\n• Finance and Administration Section:\n― Conducts contract negotiation and monitoring;\n― Keeps track of timekeeping;\n― Provides cost analysis; and\n― Tracks compensation for injury or damage to property.\nFinance and Administration is a function in the formal Incident Command System;\nhowever, CERTs will have very limited involvement, if any, with this function.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nCERT Operations\nBased on the principles of ICS, CERTs follow these protocols:\n• Each CERT must establish a command structure.\n• The CERT TL directs team activities. During activation for a disaster, the first\nperson at a pre-designated staging area assumes this responsibility. The initial\nTL may hand off this role to a pre-designated leader when that person arrives.\n• The location established by the CERT TL as the central point for command and\ncontrol of the incident is called the Command Post for the CERT. The TL stays in\nthe Command Post. If the TL has to leave, the responsibility of TL must be\ndelegated to someone in the Command Post.\nUsing the ICS structure, CERT volunteers are assigned to assist with a range of\nfunctions including:\n• Logistics—managing resources, services, and supplies;\n• Planning/Intelligence—collecting and displaying information; collecting and\ncompiling documentation; and\n• Operations—conducting fire suppression, medical operations, search and\nrescue.\nIn all situations, each unit assigned must have an identified leader to supervise tasks\nbeing performed, to account for team volunteers, and to report information to his or her\ndesignated leader.\nIn all situations, a manageable span of control is five rescuers per supervisor, with an\nacceptable spread of two to seven.\nCERT personnel assigned to Operations should always be assigned to teams\nconsisting of between one and five people:\n• One person will serve as runner and communicate with the Command Post.\n• Two people will “buddy up” to respond to the immediate needs.\n• Search and rescue teams must include at least four people, with a safety team\nremaining outside the area subject to search, and at least two people to conduct\nthe search.\nImage 2.2: Expanded CERT Operations Structure\nCERT operations section structure, showing the Operations Section Chief at the top and the three\nGroup. Leaders underneath.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nDealing with the Media\nCERT volunteers should refer any media inquiries to the CERT TL. The TL should then\nrefer the media inquiries to the Public Information Officer of the CERT’s sponsoring\norganization.\nIf the Public Information Officer of the sponsoring organization refers media to the\nCERT TL or otherwise authorizes them to speak with the media, the TL should:\n• Refrain from addressing the media until doing so will no longer inhibit or delay\nthe team’s ability to do the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest\namount of time;\n• Establish an area for briefing the media if necessary;\n• Be careful about the information he or she releases, making sure it is both\naccurate and approved for release, while also keeping in mind victims’ right to\nprivacy; and\n• Not feel compelled to answer every question asked.\nNational Incident Management System Implementation\nThe ICS is part of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). NIMS provides a\nconsistent, comprehensive approach to incident management. It applies at all\njurisdictional levels and across all emergency management functions and types of\nincidents.\nNIMS was established so that first responders, including CERT volunteers, from\ndifferent jurisdictions and disciplines can work together better to respond to disasters\nand emergencies.\n• To meet NIMS standards, CERT volunteers must complete both the IS-100\n(Introduction to Incident Command System) and IS-700 (Introduction to National\nIncident Management System [NIMS]) courses.\n• Both independent study courses are available online from FEMA at\nhttp://training.fema.gov/IS/NIMS.asp.\nExercise 2.1: ICS Functions\nPurpose: This activity will give you an opportunity to relate the ICS functions to specific\nsituations.\nInstructions:",

As other CERT volunteers arrive, the CERT TL may pass leadership\nto someone else. The CERT TL establishes operations to ensure effective\ncommunication, to maintain span of control, maintain accountability, and help the\ngreatest number without placing CERT volunteers in harm’s way.\n• One of the CERT TL’s first decisions will be to locate the team’s Command Post.\nThe staging area may become the Command Post; however, if another location\nwould be safer or otherwise better, the Command Post should be set up there.\n• As intelligence is collected and assessed, the TL must prioritize actions and work\nwith the Section Chiefs or leaders. The CERT organization is flexible and evolves\nbased on new information.\nFollowing an incident, information—and, therefore, priorities—may be change rapidly.\nCommunication between the CERT TL and response teams ensures that CERTs do not\noverextend their resources or supplies.\nCERT On-Scene Size-up\nOn-Scene Size-up should be conducted upon CERT mobilization. Size-up is a continual\nprocess that enables professional responders to make decisions and respond\nappropriately in the areas of greatest need. CERT size-up consists of 9 steps and\nshould be used in any emergency situation.\nRefer the participants to CERT On-Scene Size-up in the Participant Manual. Although\nthe checklist is not exhaustive, it does include many of the questions that CERT\nvolunteers should ask when sizing up an emergency situation.\nCERT Size-up Steps\nThe 9 steps of CERT size-up are:",

Use tape around the\narea or mark the area as heavy damage. CERT volunteers do not have any legal\nauthority to stop or restrict someone who wants to enter an area. At best, CERT\nvolunteers can warn others about the danger and inform the CERT TL\nimmediately if it is known that people are in the building.\n• If the damage is moderate: Locate, assess (e.g., quickly evaluate and treat for\nairway obstruction, bleeding, and low body temperature), and immediately\nevacuate survivors to a safe area while minimizing both the number of rescuers\ninside the building and the amount of time that they remain inside.\n• If the damage is light: Locate, assess, continue size-up, and document.\nTable 2.3: CERT Rescue Efforts Based on Degree of Damage\nDegree of Damage Should Rescue be Attempted\nNo, it is too dangerous to enter. Warn people to stay away. Inform the\nHeavy\nCERT TL immediately if it is known that people are in the building.\nYes, but perform only quick and safe removals; limit onsite medical care\nModerate to checking for breathing, stopping major bleeding, and maintaining\nbody temperature. Minimize the number of rescuers inside the building.\nLight Yes, locate, assess, continue size-up, and document.\nImage 2.3: CERT Tasks Based on Damage Level\nAugust 2019 Page 2-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: DOCUMENTATION\nIt is extremely important to document and communicate information about the disaster\nsituation and resource status.\nThe efficient flow of information makes it possible for resources to be deployed\neffectively and for professional emergency services to be applied appropriately.\nDocumenting serves several purposes:\n• The CERT TL will know what is happening throughout the incident.\n• The CERT TL will have written information to pass on to the professional\nresponders when they arrive.\n• Communication improvement between functional areas and shifts.\n• The CERT will be able to show how many volunteer hours it provided to the\nsponsoring agency or entity.\n• Liability exposure will be documented.\nUnder the CERT structure, each level of organization has documentation\nresponsibilities:\n• Section Chiefs are responsible for providing the Command Post with ongoing\ninformation about damage assessment, group status, and ongoing needs.\n• The Command Post is responsible for documenting the situation status,\nincluding:\n― Incident locations;\n― Access routes;\n― Identified hazards; and\n― Support locations.\nSupport locations include:\n• A staging area;\n• A medical treatment and assessment area; and\n• A morgue, if there are fatalities.\nThis information is vital for tracking the overall situation and for the CERT TL to be\nready to provide the documentation to the first professional responders on the scene.\nWrite it down! The most important thing to do is to write down what happened.\nThe information can be written down on the sample forms provided in this unit or it can\nbe written down on sheet of paper.\nEvery entity, such as a functional team or staging location, must have a scribe to record\neverything. Typically, the CERT TL designates the scribe and provides some simple\ninstructions.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nDocumentation Flow\nHere is how a CERT would use these standard documents within the context of an\nevent. Remind participants that, even if the forms are not used, this should give them an\nidea of the preferred information that needs to be collected and communicated between\ngroups.\n• CERT volunteers complete the Damage Assessment Form as they travel through\nthe area to the CERT’s staging location. The form is then given to the CERT TL.\nThe form provides a summary of overall hazards in selected areas, and the\ninformation is used for prioritizing and formulating activities.\n• The CERT TL assembles teams and makes assignments based on the damage\nassessment information. This person keeps the CERT Assignment Tracking Log,\nwhich is the most important tool for recording the activities of the functional\nteams and overall situation status.\n• A scribe at the staging location signs in each volunteer using the Personnel\nResources Check-In Form, noting any preferred team assignments or skills. This\ninformation needs to be passed on to the Command Post.\n• The Command Post and the functional team share the Briefing Assignment\nForm. The CERT TL uses the front side of the form to communicate instructions\n(e.g., address, incident type, and team objectives) about the incident. The scribe\nof the functional team uses the blank side of the form to log team actions. The\nform is then returned to the Command Post when the team checks in.\n• The Treatment Area Record is available to document each person brought into\nthe treatment area and his or her condition.\n• The Communications Log is on-hand to log incoming and outgoing\ntransmissions; it is typically kept by the radio operator.\n• The Equipment Inventory is kept in the area or vehicle in which equipment is\nstored.\n• The General Message form is accessible for sending messages between any\ncommand levels and groups. The messages must be clear and concise.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.1: CERT Damage Assessment Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.2: CERT Personnel Resources Check-In Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.3: CERT Assignment Tracking Log\nAugust 2019 Page 2-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.4a: CERT Briefing Assignment Form\nAugust 2019e Page 2-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.4b: CERT Team Action Log\nAugust 2019 Page 2-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.5: CERT Treatment Area Record\nAugust 2019 Page 2-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.6: CERT Communications Log\nAugust 2019 Page 2-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.7: CERT Equipment Inventory Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm 2.8: CERT General Message Form\nAugust 2019 Page 2-22\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nDocumentation Forms\nThere are standard forms that can be used to facilitate documentation and information\nflow. The forms are functionally consistent with ICS forms and are designed to be NIMS\ncompliant.\nThe CERT forms are:\n• Damage Assessment;\n• Personnel Resources Check-In;\n• CERT Assignment Tracking Log;\n• Briefing Assignment;\n• Treatment Area Record;\n• Communications Log;\n• Equipment Inventory; and\n• General Message.\nRemember scribes can produce useful, high-quality documentation without using the\nforms as long as they take detailed notes of all activities.\nArea maps, site maps, and building plans are also very useful for tracking response\nactivities.\nTable 2.4: Forms Used for Response Documentation\nForm Purpose\nCompleted by CERT volunteers as they travel through the\narea to the CERT’s staging location, then given to the\nCERT Team Leader; provides a summary of overall\nhazards in selected areas, including:\n• Fires;\nDamage Assessment\n• Utility hazards;\n[CERT Form #1]\n• Structural damage;\n• Injuries and deaths;\n• Available access; and\n• Essential for prioritizing and formulating action\nplans.\nUsed to sign in CERT volunteers as they arrive at the\nstaging location; provides information about:\n• Who is on site;\nPersonnel Resources Check-In • When they arrived;\n[CERT Form #2] • When they were assigned;\n• Their special skills; and\n• Used by staging personnel to track personnel\navailability.\nUsed by the Command Post for keeping awareness of\nCERT Assignment Tracking Log\nsituation status; contains essential information for tracking\n[CERT Form #3]\nthe overall situation.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-23\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nForm Purpose\nUsed by the Command Post to provide instructions to\nBriefing Assignment\nfunctional teams; used by teams to log their actions and\n[CERT Form #4 a, b]\nreport new damage assessment information.\nCompleted by medical treatment area personnel to record\nTreatment Area Record\nsurvivors entering the treatment area, their condition, and\n[CERT Form #5]\ntheir status.\nCommunications Log\nCompleted by the radio operator; used to log incoming and\n[CERT Form #6 (based on ICS\noutgoing transmissions.\n309)]\nEquipment Inventory\nUsed to check out and check in CERT-managed\n[CERT Form #7(based on ICS\nequipment.\n303)]\nUsed for sending messages between command levels and\ngroups; messages should be clear and concise and should\nfocus on such key issues as:\nGeneral Message\n• Assignment completion;\n[CERT Form #8 (ICS 213)]\n• Additional resources required;\n• Special information; and\n• Status update.\nAugust 2019 Page 2-24\n\n\nCERT Unit 2: CERT Organization Participant Manual\nUNIT 2 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• Emergency response agencies and CERT use the ICS to manage emergency\noperations. ICS provides a flexible means of managing personnel, facilities,\nequipment, and communication and can be expanded when necessary.\n• The key question CERT Team Leaders must always ask is: “Is it safe for CERT\nvolunteers to attempt the rescue?” Whether or not to attempt a rescue depends\non the degree of damage to the structure involved. Remember: CERT volunteers’\nsafety is the top priority.\n• It is vital to document and communicate information about situation and resource\nstatus to all CERT levels.\n• Sections, Groups, and Teams must provide the Command Post with ongoing\ninformation about damage assessment, incident status, and ongoing needs.\n• The Command Post must document the situation status, so the overall disaster\nsituation can be tracked and reported to emergency response agencies.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiar with the unit that will be covered in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page

Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: UNIT 3 OVERVIEW\nUnderstanding the medical operations environment in a disaster is crucial to CERT’s\nsuccess in assisting emergency responders. Units 3 and 4, Disaster Medical Operations\nPart I and II, teach life-saving steps CERT volunteers can take immediately following\ntrauma. It also provides an overview of how emergency responders apply and organize\ndisaster medical care in the event of a large-scale disaster. CERT volunteer’s\nassistance with disaster medical operations can play a vital role in limiting deaths from\ntrauma.\nUnits 3 and 4 do not provide an absolute way of how to manage disaster medical\noperations. Many localities will handle disaster medical operations differently, and there\nis not one concrete way to teach this material. Instead, the goal of Units 3 and 4 is to\nprovide a high-level overview about the immediate medical interventions CERT\nvolunteers can take to save lives, including how disaster medical operations may\noperate.\nIn a disaster, there may be more survivors than rescuers, and assistance from medical\nprofessionals may not be immediately available. While emergency medical responders\nare quick to arrive, any delay between injury and the initiation of care can result in\ndeath. Those nearest to someone with life-threatening injuries are in the best position to\nprovide the first care, which should focus on the most essential actions. These essential\nactions include moving someone away from ongoing danger, stopping life-threatening\nbleeding, positioning the injured so they can breathe, keeping them warm, and providing\ncomfort.\nCERT volunteers are trained to be part of disaster medical operations and to assist in\nproviding treatment for life-threatening conditions. Remember, the mission of CERT is\nto provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In a disaster with many\nsurvivors, time will be critical. CERT volunteers must work quickly and efficiently to help\nas many survivors as possible.\nAll CERT participants are encouraged to take basic first aid and CPR training; however,\neven if you have taken first aid courses you will need to understand CERT covers basic\nmedical interventions for life-threatening (traumatic) injuries. This course does not teach\nCPR. To find a CPR course near you, search your local chapters of the American Red\nCross and American Heart Association.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:",

Provide basic first-aid care for non-life-threatening injuries.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: TREATING LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS\nWithout treatment, severe bleeding and airway obstruction can quickly lead to death.\nThe first priority of CERT volunteers assisting in disaster medical operations is to attend\nto these conditions by controlling bleeding and properly position a patient, so they can\nbreathe.\nPrior to treatment, it is critical to ensure that both the survivor and rescuer are in a safe\nenvironment to administer care. CERT volunteers should use their best judgement to\ndetermine if the situation is safe enough to help a survivor.\nSome questions CERT volunteers can consider are:\n• Do I feel safe at this spot?\n• Should I leave a move to a safer location, or am I able to stay and start providing\ncare immediately?\n• If I leave, can I take anyone with me?\nWhatever the decision is, the goal is to get help to the people who need it as soon as\npossible.\nApproaching the Patient\nWhen able, CERT volunteers should first ensure they are wearing the appropriate and\nproper personal protective equipment (PPE). For a detailed list of PPE, please\nreference Unit 1.\nThere are several steps to take when approaching a patient.\nStep 1: If the patient is conscious, be sure he or she can see you.\nStep 2: Identify yourself by giving your name and indicating the organization with which\nyou are affiliated.\nStep 3: Always request permission to treat an individual. If the individual is\nunconscious, it is assumed that the patient has given “implied consent,” and you may\ntreat him or her. Ask a parent or guardian for permission to treat a child, if possible.\nStep 4: Whenever possible, respect cultural differences.\nStep 5: Remember, all medical patients are legally entitled to confidentiality (HIPAA).\nWhen dealing with patients, always be mindful and respectful of the privacy of their\nmedical condition.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nControlling Bleeding\nThe average person has approximately five liters of blood. Severe blood loss can result\nin irreversible shock. This means that if you lose about half of your body’s blood supply,\nno matter what anyone does to try to save you, death is unavoidable. You must get\nbleeding under control as soon as possible.\nIndications of life-threatening bleeding include:\n• Spurting/steady bleeding;\n• Blood is pooling;\n• Blood is soaking through overlying clothes;\n• Blood is soaking through bandages; and\n• Amputation.\nLife-threatening decreases in blood pressure often are associated with a state of shock.\nThere are typically four stages of excessive bleeding.\nStage 1: Loss of <15% of blood volume. Patient appears normal with a slightly\nincreased heart rate.\nStage 2: Loss of 15%-30% of blood volume. Patient’s body is able to compensate for\nthe loss of blood but may appear agitated or anxious as vital signs rise.\nStage 3: Loss of 30%-40% of blood volume. Patient becomes unable to compensate\nand condition worsens. If left untreated will proceed to irreversible shock. Patient\nappears confused.\nStage 4: Loss of >40% of blood volume. Patient enters irreversible shock. Patient\nappears lethargic and death will occur within minutes because of overwhelming and\nirreversible damage to vital organs.\nTable 3.1: Stages of Severe Bleeding\nHeart Rate Blood Breath Patient\nStage Blood Loss\nPressure Rate\nLess than Normal (<100 bpm) Normal 14-20 Patient appears\nI\n15% normal\nFast (>100 bpm) Slightly Low 20-30 Patient may feel\nII 15%-40%\nanxious\nVery Fast Low 30-40 Patient feels\nIII 30%-40%\n(>120 bpm) confused\nGreater Critical (>140 bpm) Critical >35 Patient feels\nIV\nthan 40% lethargic\nTypes of bleeding are characterized by the speed of the blood flow.\nArterial bleeding: Arteries transport blood under high pressure. Blood coming from an\nartery will spurt.\nVenous bleeding: Veins transport blood under low pressure. Blood coming from a vein\nwill flow.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nCapillary bleeding: Capillaries also carry blood under low pressure. Blood coming from\ncapillaries will ooze.\nDirect Pressure\nThe first way to try to control excessive bleeding is through applying direct pressure. To\ncontrol and stop bleeding through direct pressure, follow the steps below.\nStep 1: Find the source(s) of bleeding.\nStep 2: If you have something to put in between the blood and your hands, use it. (e.g.,\ngloves, a cloth, a plastic bag.)\nStep 3: Apply firm, steady pressure directly on the source of the bleeding. Push hard to\nstop or slow bleeding—even if it is painful to the injured!\nStep 4: Keep pressure applied until EMS takes over care or bleeding has stopped. If\nyou are unsure if bleeding has stopped, continue applying pressure and wait for EMS.\nSome things to keep in mind when applying direct pressure:\n• Try to provide a barrier against the blood, if possible. Gloves are best.\n• Do not use the same gloves or barrier on more than one person.\n• If your barrier becomes blood soaked, replace it, but do not layer more things on\ntop of it.\n• Do not place bulky layers in between your hands and the source of the wound\nbecause it decreases the effectiveness of the pressure.\n• Correctly applied pressure may not be comfortable for the injured. Do not let up;\nhold pressure until EMS arrives.\nTourniquets\nIf you cannot stop the bleeding by applying direct pressure and EMS professionals are\ndelayed in responding, a tourniquet may be a viable option to save a person from\nbleeding to death. Tourniquets have been used effectively in combat to control bleeding\nin a wounded soldier’s extremities (arms or legs) and are increasingly being used by\nuniformed responders in civilian emergencies. Tourniquets are safe and effective when\napplied appropriately; you are more likely to save a life than cause the loss of a limb if\nyou use a tourniquet.\nA tourniquet is a tight bandage, which when placed around a limb and tightened, cuts\noff the blood supply to the part of the limb beyond it.\nIf a commercial tourniquet is not readily available, you can try to create one yourself\nusing something that is broad, flexible, strong, and able to be twisted, tightened, and\nsecured, such as a webbed belt or luggage strap or material. Improvised tourniquets\noften fail, but you can attempt to use them as a last resort to at least slow the bleeding.\nHow to use a tourniquet:\nStep 1: Place as high as possible on the injured limb – closest to the torso. (You can\nplace it over clothing.)\nStep 2: Pull the strap through the buckle.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nStep 3: Twist the rod tightly until bleeding stops/slows significantly. (May be very\npainful.)\nStep 4: Secure the rod.\nStep 5: If bleeding does not stop, place a second tourniquet.\nStep 6: Leave in place until EMS takes over care.\nImage 3.1: Tourniquet\nRecognizing Shock\nThe body will initially compensate for blood loss and mask the symptoms of shock;\ntherefore, shock is often difficult to diagnose. It is possible — and, in fact, common —\nfor an individual suffering from shock to be fully coherent and not complaining of pain.\nPay attention to subtle clues, as failure to recognize shock will have serious\nconsequences.\nMain signs of shock:\n• Rapid and shallow breathing;\n• Capillary refill of greater than two seconds; and\n• Failure to follow simple commands, such as “squeeze my hand.”\nWhen a patient is in shock, avoid rough or excessive handling. It is also important to\nmaintain the patient’s body temperature.\nMaintaining Body Temperature\nIf necessary, place a blanket or other material under and/or over the patient to provide\nprotection from extreme ground temperatures (hot or cold). People with very serious\ninjuries are more susceptible to hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature.\nHypothermia increases the risk of death in survivors with serious injuries, so you must\nmaintain normal body temperatures in patients as much as possible.\nTo keep a person warm, you should:\n• Remove wet clothing;\nAugust 2019 Page 3-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\n• Place something between the injured person and the ground (e.g., cardboard,\njacket, blanket, or anything that provides physical separation);\n• Wrap the injured person with dry layers (e.g., coat, blanket, or Mylar emergency\nblanket); and\n• Shield the injured person from the wind with your body or surrounding objects.\nHypothermia and other cold-related injuries will be discussed in greater detail later in\nthis unit.\nExercise 3.1: Controlling Bleeding\nPurpose: This exercise will provide a chance to practice using the techniques for\ncontrolling bleeding.\nInstructions:",

Apply a pressure bandage or tourniquet (if available).\n4. Repeat the process twice.\n5. Swap roles and have the new rescuer complete the above steps.\nOpening the Airway\nPositioning an injured patient to keep their airway open and clear is critical to saving\ntheir life. The best position for the body is one in which the chest can expand fully, and\nthe airway is not at risk of being obstructed. In other words, the best position is one in\nwhich the tongue cannot flop back into the individual’s throat and one in which blood or\nfluid does not end up in the lungs (aspirated), particularly in the case with someone with\nfacial trauma.\nThe respiratory system includes the following components:\n• Lung;\n• Bronchus;\n• Larynx;\n• Pharynx;\n• Nasal Cavity; and\n• Trachea.\nThere are different ways to position an injured patient to keep their airway open\ndepending on if the patient is conscious or unconscious.\nPositioning a Conscious Patient\nSomeone who is awake will naturally assume the position that is best for them given\ntheir injuries. Despite how it looks to you, let them self-manage their airway by\npositioning their own body. Assist if needed.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nThe tripod position is a natural way to open your airway – think of catching your breath\nafter sprinting. In the tripod position, the lungs and ribcage are able to expand as fully\nas possible.\n• When sitting on a raised platform (e.g., chair, bench): Legs shoulder width\napart, elbows or hands on knees, and leaning forward slightly.\n• When standing: Legs shoulder width apart, hands on knees arms straight, and\nleaning forward with flat back.\nPositioning an Unconscious Patient\nIf an individual is unconscious, you can help by turning the person on his or her side so\ntheir chest can expand, tilting the head to drain fluid away from the airway. To assess\nan unconscious patient, consider the following diagram:\nImage 3.2: Positioning an Unconscious Patient\nRecovery Position\nIf you decide to move a patient into the recovery position, place the patient’s body like\nthis:\n• Body: Laid on its side;\n• Bottom Arm: Reached outward;\n• Top Arm: Rest hand on bicep of bottom arm;\n• Head: Rest on hand;\n• Legs: Bent slightly;\n• Chin: Raised forward; and\n• Mouth: Pointed downward.\nAlthough the risk is very small, it is possible that moving someone into the recovery\nposition could cause harm to the person’s spine. To prevent this:\n• Try to support the head and neck when rolling them onto their side.\n• Do not move them more than necessary.\nJaw-thrust Maneuver\nWhen the patient is unconscious, and you suspect there is an airway obstruction, clear\nthe airway using the jaw-thrust maneuver.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nTo perform this maneuver on an adult, kneel above the patient’s head and:\n• Put one hand on each side of the patient’s head with the thumbs near the\ncorners of the mouth pointed toward the chin, using the elbows for support.\n• Slide the fingers into position under the angles of the patient’s jawbone without\nmoving the head or neck.\n• Thrust the jaw upward without moving the head or neck to lift the jaw and open\nthe airway.\nExercise 3.2: Recovery Position\nPurpose: This exercise will provide a chance to practice using the techniques for\nmoving a patient into the recovery position.\nInstructions:",

No special skills are needed—just a calm and reassuring\npresence. Unit 5 will discuss disaster psychology in greater depth; however, it is\nimportant to note that providing comfort is a part of the immediate care CERT\nvolunteers can provide.\nA Dialogue for Providing Comfort\nShare names and ask basic questions, for example:\n• How can I help?\n• What do you need?\n• What happened?\nYou can also provide comfort to the patient by supplying information about:\n• What you currently know about what happened without speculating;\n• What is being done to assist them; and\n• What is going to happen next.\nWhat can you do?\n• Keep them warm.\n• Offer a hand to hold.\n• Maintain eye contact.\n• Be patient and understanding.\n• If you have to move on to provide aid to another person, let him or her know.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: BASIC FIRST-AID CARE\nTreating Burns\nThe first step in treating burns is to conduct a thorough size-up. A few examples of\nburn-related size-up questions to ask are:\n• What caused the burn?\n• Is the danger still present?\n• When did the burning cease?\nThe objectives of first aid treatment for burns are to:\n• Prevent hypothermia;\n• Manage pain; and\n• Reduce the risk of infection.\nHeat, chemicals, electrical current, or radiation may cause burns. The severity of a burn\ndepends on the:\n• Temperature of the burning agent;\n• Period of time the patient was exposed;\n• Area of the body that was affected;\n• Size of the area burned; and\n• Depth of the burn.\nBurn Classifications\nDepending on the severity, burns may affect all three layers of skin.",

Put out any flames and remove\nsmoldering clothing unless it is stuck to the skin.\n• Cool skin or clothing, if they are still hot, by immersing them in cool water for not\nmore than one minute or covering with clean compresses that have been soaked\nin cool water and wrung out. *Note that rapid temperature changes can cause\nshock in the patient, so it is important to assess the size and severity of the burn\nprior to attempting to cool the skin to prevent a drop-in body temperature.\n• Cooling sources include water from the bathroom or kitchen; garden hose; and\nsoaked towels, sheets, or other cloths.\n• Do not use ice. Ice causes vessel constriction.\nDress the burn:\n• Cover loosely with dry, sterile dressings to keep air out, reduce pain, and prevent\ninfection.\n• Wrap fingers and toes loosely and individually when treating severe burns to the\nhands and feet.\n• Loosen clothing near the affected area. Remove jewelry if necessary, taking care\nto document what you removed, when, and to whom you gave it.\n• Do not apply antiseptics, ointments, or other remedies.\n• Do not remove shreds of tissue, break blisters, or remove adhered particles of\nclothing (cut burned-in clothing around the burn.)\nGuidelines for Treating Chemical Burns\nUnlike more traditional burns, chemical burns do not result from extreme heat, and\ntherefore, treatment differs greatly (e.g., decontamination procedures). If you suspect a\nchemical burn, it is best to defer treatment to trained medical professionals.\nChemical burns are not always obvious. Consider chemical burns as a possibility if the\npatient’s skin is burning and there is no sign of a fire. If you suspect a chemical burn:\n• Protect yourself from contact with the substance. Use your protective gear,\nespecially goggles, mask, and gloves;\n• Be sure to remove any affected clothing or jewelry;\n• If the irritant is dry, gently brush away as much as possible. Always brush away\nfrom the eyes and away from the patient and yourself;\n• Use lots of cool running water to flush the chemical from the skin for at least 10\nminutes. The running water will dilute the chemical fast enough to prevent the\ninjury from getting worse;\nAugust 2019 Page 3-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\n• Apply a cool, wet compress to relieve pain; and\n• Cover the wound very loosely with a dry, sterile, or clean cloth so that the cloth\nwill not stick to the wound.\nWound Care\nThe main treatment for wounds includes:\n• Control bleeding; and\n• Apply dressing and bandage.\nTreatment for controlling bleeding was covered earlier in this unit. The focus of this\nsection is on bandaging, which will help to prevent secondary infection.\nBandaging Wounds\nOnce you have controlled bleeding, you will need to apply a dressing and bandage to\nhelp maintain the clot and prevent infection.\nThere is a difference between a dressing and a bandage:\n• Apply dressing directly to the wound. Whenever possible, a dressing should be\nsterile; and\n• A bandage holds the dressing in place.\nIf a wound is still bleeding, the bandage should place enough pressure on the wound to\nhelp control bleeding without interfering with circulation.\nRules of Dressing\nThe rules of dressing are:\n• If there is active bleeding (i.e., if the dressing is soaked with blood), redress over\nthe existing dressing and maintain pressure to control bleeding; and\n• In the absence of active bleeding, maintain the pressure and keep the wound\nbandaged until further treatment by a medical professional.\nSigns of possible infection include:\n• Swelling around the wound site;\n• Discoloration;\n• Discharge from the wound; and\n• Red striations from the wound site.\nAmputations\nIf CERT volunteers are assisting a patient with a severed body part there are a few\nguidelines to follow. Note that CERT volunteers should never amputate a body part.\nWhen the severed body part can be located, CERT volunteers should:\n• Save tissue parts, wrapped in clean material and placed in a plastic bag, if\navailable. Label them with the date, time, and patient’s name;\n• Keep the tissue parts cool, but NOT in direct contact with ice; and\n• Keep the severed body part with the patient.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nImpaled Objects\nSometimes, you may also encounter some patients who have foreign objects lodged in\ntheir bodies, usually as the result of flying debris. This situation is usually outside the\nscope of CERT training. The best course of action is to find trained medical personnel\n(EMS) to care for a patient with an impaled object. However, in the event that EMS is\nstill a long way from the scene or otherwise unavailable, there are a few steps you can\ntake to provide care.\nWhen a foreign object impales a patient, you should:\n• Immobilize the affected body part;\n• Not attempt to move or remove the object, unless it is obstructing the airway;\n• Try to control bleeding at the entrance wound without placing undue pressure on\nthe foreign object;\n• Clean and dress the wound making sure to stabilize the impaled object; and\n• Wrap bulky dressings around the object to keep it from moving.\nTreating Fractures, Dislocations, Sprains, and Strains\nThe objective when treating a suspected fracture, sprain, or strain is to immobilize the\ninjury and the joints immediately above and below the injury site. Because it is difficult to\ndistinguish among fractures, sprains, or strains, if uncertain of the type of injury, CERT\nmembers should treat the injury as a fracture.\nFractures\nA fracture is a complete break, a chip, or a crack in a bone. There are several types of\nfractures.\n• An open fracture is a broken bone with some kind of wound that allows\ncontaminants to enter into or around the fracture site.\n• A closed fracture is a broken bone with no associated wound. First aid\ntreatment for closed fractures may require only splinting.\nImage 3.3: Open and Closed Fractures\nAugust 2019 Page 3-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nIf the limb is angled, then it is a displaced fracture, which can be described by the\ndegree of displacement of the bone fragments.\nNondisplaced fractures are difficult to identify, with the main signs being pain and\nswelling. You should treat a suspected fracture as a fracture until professional treatment\nis available.\nImage 3.4: Displaced and Nondisplaced Fractures\nTreating an Open Fracture\nClosed fractures are generally treated with splinting, but open fractures are more\ndangerous because they pose a significant risk of severe bleeding and infection.\nTherefore, they are a higher priority and volunteers should check them more frequently.\nWhen treating an open fracture:\n• Do not draw the exposed bone ends back into the tissue; and\n• Do not irrigate the wound.\nYou should:\n• Cover the wound with a sterile dressing and apply pressure;\n• Splint the fracture without disturbing the wound; and\n• Place a moist 4 by 4-inch dressing over the bone end to keep it from drying out.\nDislocations\nDislocations are another common injury in emergencies. A dislocation is an injury to the\nligaments around a joint that is so severe that it permits a separation of the bone from\nits normal position in a joint.\nThe signs of a dislocation are similar to those of a closed fracture, and you should treat\na suspected dislocation like a closed fracture.\nYou should not try to relocate a suspected dislocation. You should immobilize the joint\nuntil professional medical help is available.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nSprains and Strains\nA sprain involves a stretching or tearing of ligaments at a joint. Typically, stretching or\nextending the joint beyond its normal limits causes the sprain.\nA sprain is considered a partial dislocation, although the bone either remains in place or\nis able to fall back into place after the injury. Whether an injury is a strain, sprain, or\nclosed fracture, treat the injury as if it is a closed fracture.\nThe most common signs of a sprain are:\n• Tenderness at the site of the injury;\n• Swelling and/or bruising; and\n• Restricted use or loss of use.\nSplinting\nSplinting is the most common procedure for immobilizing an injury.\nCardboard is the most common type of material used for makeshift splints, but a variety\nof materials can be used, including:\n• Soft materials: Towels, blankets, or pillows, tied with bandaging materials or soft\ncloths; and\n• Rigid materials: A board, metal strip, folded magazine or newspaper, or another\nrigid item.\nVolunteers can create anatomical splints by securing a fractured bone to an adjacent\nun-fractured bone. Usually, anatomical splints are reserved for fingers and toes, but, in\nan emergency, volunteers may splint legs together.\nUse soft materials to fill the gap between the splinting material and the body part.\nWith this type of injury, there will be swelling. Remove restrictive clothing, shoes, and\njewelry when necessary to prevent these items from acting as unintended tourniquets.\nSplint Illustrations\nImage 3.5: Cardboard Splint\nTo create a cardboard splint, turn up the edges of the cardboard to form a “mold” in\nwhich the injured limb can rest.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nImage 3.5: Cardboard Splint\nTo splint using a towel, roll up the towel and wrap it around the limb, then tie it in place.\nImage 3.7: Pillow Splint\nFor a pillow splint, wrap and tie the pillow around the limb.\nImage 3.8: Anatomical Splint\nAn anatomical splint is one in which the injured leg is tied at intervals to the non-injured\nleg, using a blanket as padding between the legs.\nExercise 3.3: Splinting\nPurpose: This exercise will provide you with a chance to practice splinting techniques.\nInstructions:",

After several observed attempts at splinting, the rescuer and the patient will swap\nroles.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nTreating Cold-Related Injuries\nCold-related injuries include:\n• Hypothermia, which is a condition that occurs when the body’s temperature\ndrops below normal; and\n• Frostbite, which occurs when extreme cold shuts down blood flow to extremities,\ncausing tissue death.\nHypothermia\nHypothermia may be caused by exposure to cold or by trauma. The primary signs and\nsymptoms of hypothermia are:\n• A body temperature of 95º F (37º C) or lower;\n• Redness or blueness of the skin; and\n• Numbness accompanied by shivering.\nIn later stages, hypothermia will be accompanied by:\n• Slurred speech;\n• Unpredictable behavior; and\n• Listlessness.\nBecause hypothermia can set in within only a few minutes, treat patients rescued from\ncold air or water environments first by:\n• Removing wet clothing;\n• Placing something between the injured person and the ground (e.g., cardboard,\njacket, blanket, or anything that provides physical separation);\n• Wrapping the injured person with dry layers (e.g., coat, blanket, or Mylar\nemergency blanket);\n• Shielding the injured person from the wind with your body or surrounding objects;\n• Not attempting to use massage to warm affected body parts; and\n• Placing an unconscious patient in the recovery position.\nFrostbite\nA person’s blood vessels constrict in cold weather in an effort to preserve body heat. In\nextreme cold, the body will further constrict blood vessels in the extremities in an effort\nto shunt blood toward the core organs (e.g., heart, lungs, intestines). The combination\nof inadequate circulation and extreme temperatures will cause tissue in these\nextremities to freeze, and in some cases, tissue death will result. Frostbite is most\ncommon in the nose, ears, hands, and feet.\nThere are several key signs and symptoms of frostbite:\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, purple, black);\n• Burning or tingling sensation, at times not localized to the injury site; and\n• Partial or complete numbness.\nWarm a patient suffering from frostbite slowly! Thawing the frozen extremity too rapidly\ncan cause chilled blood to flow to the heart, shocking it, and potentially stopping it.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\n• Immerse injured area in warm (NOT hot) water, approximately 107.6º F.\n• DO NOT allow the body part to re-freeze, as this will exacerbate the injury.\n• DO NOT attempt to use massage to warm body parts. Frostbite results in the\nformation of ice crystals in the tissue; rubbing could potentially cause a great deal\nof damage!\nWrap affected body parts in dry, sterile dressing. Again, it is vital to complete this task\ncarefully to reduce the likelihood of further tissue damage.\nTreating Heat-Related Injuries\nAs a CERT volunteer, you may encounter several types of heat-related injuries during a\ndisaster, including the following:\n• Heat cramps: muscle spasms brought on by over-exertion in extreme heat.\n• Heat exhaustion: occurs when an individual exercises or works in extreme heat,\nresulting in loss of body fluids through heavy sweating. Blood flow to the skin\nincreases, causing blood flow to decrease to the vital organs. This results in a\nmild form of shock.\n• Heat stroke: life-threatening condition when the patient’s temperature control\nsystem shuts down, and body temperature can rise so high that brain damage\nand death may result.\nHeat Exhaustion\nThe symptoms of heat exhaustion are:\n• Cool, moist, pale, or flushed skin;\n• Heavy sweating;\n• Headache;\n• Nausea or vomiting;\n• Dizziness; and/or\n• Exhaustion.\nA patient suffering heat exhaustion will have a near normal body temperature. If left\nuntreated, heat exhaustion will develop into heat stroke.\nHeat Stroke\nSome or all of the following symptoms characterize heat stroke:\n• Hot, red skin;\n• Lack of perspiration;\n• Changes in consciousness; and/or\n• Rapid, weak pulse and rapid, shallow breathing.\nIn a heat stroke patient, body temperature can be very high — as high as 105º F. If an\nindividual suffering from heat stroke is not treated, death can result.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nTreatment\nTreatment is similar for both heat exhaustion and heat stroke.",

Have a heat stroke patient drink water, SLOWLY, at the rate of approximately\nhalf a glass of water every 15 minutes. Consuming too much water too quickly\nwill cause nausea and vomiting in a patient of heat sickness.\n4. If the patient is experiencing vomiting, cramping, or is losing consciousness, DO\nNOT administer food or drink. Alert a medical professional as soon as possible\nand keep a close watch on the individual until professional help is available.\nInsect Bites and Stings\nIn a disaster environment, insect bites and stings may be more common than is typical\nas these creatures, like people, are under additional stress.\nThe specific symptoms vary depending on the type of creature, but generally, bites and\nstings can result in redness and itching, tingling or burning at the site of the injury, and\noften a welt on the skin at the site.\nTreatment for insect bites and stings follows the steps below.\nStep 1: Remove the stinger if still present by scraping the edge of a credit card or other\nstiff, straight-edged object across the stinger. Do not use tweezers; these may squeeze\nthe venom sac and increase the amount of venom released.\nStep 2: Wash the site thoroughly with soap and water.\nStep 3: Place ice (wrapped in a washcloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and\nthen off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process.\nAllergic Reactions to Bites and Stings\nThe greatest concern with any insect bite or sting is a severe allergic reaction, or\nanaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs when an allergic reaction becomes so severe that it\ncompromises the airway. If you suspect anaphylaxis:\n• Calm the individual;\n• If possible, find and help administer a patient’s Epi-pen. (Many severe allergy\nsufferers carry one at all times); and\n• DO NOT administer medicine aside from the Epi-pen. This includes pain\nrelievers, allergy medicine, etc.\nAugust 2019 Page 3-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations-Part 1 Participant Manual\nUNIT 3 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• CERT volunteers’ ability to provide first, live-saving measures can be critical\nduring a disaster.\n• Life-saving measures CERT volunteers can take, include:\n― Controlling severe bleeding using direct pressure and/or a tourniquet;\n― Maintaining normal body temperature; and\n― Opening airways and positioning patients correctly.\n• CERT volunteers can be of great value to injured and emotional patients simply\nby offering comfort and support.

While these incidents are infrequent, CERT volunteers can play an\nimportant role by supporting local resources in responding to the incident.\nExamples of mass casualty incidents include:\n• Commuter train derailment;\n• Multi-car accident;\n• Bus accident;\n• Building collapse; and\n• Natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes).\nIn mass casualty incidents, first responder personnel:\n• Establish command and control of the incident area;\n• Conduct a scene size-up and set-up;\n• Send survivors with relatively minor injuries to a holding area to await treatment;\n• Identify survivors who require life-saving interventions and treat them\nimmediately;\n• Identify deceased victims as well as survivors too severely injured to save;\n• Manage medical transportation for survivors who require additional treatment;\n• Secure the area to protect first responders, survivors, and evidence for law\nenforcement investigations; and\n• Remove debris and other safety or health threats.\nIn addition to providing critical life-saving interventions, first responders must organize a\nlikely chaotic situation when they arrive on scene. To support first responders, CERT\nvolunteers must understand their role during mass casualty incidents.\nRole of CERT Volunteers during Mass Casualty Incidents\nWhether dispatched to the scene or located nearby by coincidence, the first task of a\nCERT volunteer is to conduct a scene size-up. Take a moment to look around the\nscene and determine the appropriate course of action.\n• Call 9-1-1 and provide the operator with the information gathered during your\ninitial size-up.\n• Put on your personal protective equipment (PPE), and any CERT affiliated gear,\nsuch as a hat, vest, or shirt.\n• Locate the nearest first responder and identify yourself as a CERT volunteer.\nGive them your local agency affiliation.\n• If a first responder is not available, assess the situation and determine whether\nyou can provide life-saving interventions, such as controlling bleeding or opening\nan airway.\n• Once responders have arrived, provide them with detailed information from your\nsize-up, and ask how you may be of assistance. Again, communicate your CERT\naffiliation to first responder personnel.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\n• For your safety, first responders may ask you to leave the area. After leaving,\nreport the incident and your role to your CERT Team Leader and/or local agency\nCERT affiliation.\n• Communication is key for supporting first responders. CERT volunteers can\nprovide valuable information to support an effective response.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: FUNCTIONS OF DISASTER MEDICAL OPERATIONS\nDisaster medical operations are the tasks associated with survivor treatment and\nsupport during a mass casualty incident. The major functions of disaster medical\noperations are:\n• Triage/Assessment: The initial assessment and sorting of survivors for\ntreatment based on the severity of their injuries;\n• Treatment: The medical services provided to survivors;\n• Transport: The movement of survivors from the scene to the treatment area or\nmedical facility;\n• Morgue: The temporary holding area for patients who died at the scene or the\ntreatment area; and\n• Supply: The hub for getting and distributing supplies.\nImage 4.11: Disaster Medical Operations Organization\nDisaster Medical Operations Organization showing the functions of disaster medical operations:\nTriage/Assessment, Transport, Treatment, Morgue, and Supply\nTriage/assessment and transport are functions of both search and rescue operations\nand medical operations.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: ESTABLISHING MEDICAL TREATMENT AREAS\nAs soon as injured survivors are confirmed, first responders will begin to set up one or\nmore treatment area(s). The location of treatment areas will take into consideration\nsafety for rescuers and survivors, as well as, ease of access to resources (e.g., medical\nsupplies, transport areas). First responders may call on CERT volunteers to help\nestablish treatment areas or supply needs.\nDecentralized Treatment Areas: It is sometimes necessary to set up more than one\nmedical treatment location. The severity of the damage, number of injuries and\ncasualties, and the safety of the immediate environment determine where the initial\ntreatment area(s) should be located. Having multiple treatment areas can provide life-\nsaving interventions when a central location is too far away from the initial treatment\narea.\n• A medical treatment location should be set up a safe distance from, but not too\nfar from, each of the damage sites.\n• Each treatment location should include physically separated treatment areas for\nsurvivors and a morgue.\n• Survivors remain under treatment at the location until first responders can\ntransport them to a location for professional medical care.\nCentralized Treatment Areas: In an event with few injured survivors at several sites,\nfirst responders may need to establish one central medical treatment location. A\ncentralized location may need to be set up even when there are decentralized sites\nestablished.\n• The location should include physically separated treatment areas and a morgue.\n• Move survivors to the treatment area from where they were initially rescued,\nassessed, and treated. They should remain under treatment there until first\nresponders can transport them to a location for professional medical treatment.\n• A central medical treatment area facilitates the effective use of resources since a\nlimited number of medical operation personnel in one location can take care of a\ngreater number of survivors.\n• First responders and other medical professionals will generally be able to\ntransport the injured more efficiently from one central location than from multiple\ndecentralized locations.\n• Move the deceased to the morgue, which should be separated from the survivor\ntreatment area, in the centralized treatment area.\nWhether a treatment area is centralized or is one in several decentralized areas, the\nlocation(s) selected should be:\n• Accessible by transportation vehicles (ambulances, trucks, helicopters, etc.); and\n• Expandable.\nSafety for Rescuers and Survivors\nCERT volunteers may play a role in light search and rescue operations. Unit 7: Light\nSearch and Rescue will cover this subject more in depth. As survivors are located,\nAugust 2019 Page 4-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nrescued, and assessed, they are moved to a location where medical personnel can treat\nthem. As a reminder, the severity of the damage, number of injuries and casualties, and\nthe safety of the immediate environment determine where the initial treatment area(s)\nshould be located. In all cases, your individual safety is the number one priority.\n• In structures with light damage, CERT members assess the survivors as they\nfind them. Further medical treatment is performed in a safe location inside the\ndesignated treatment areas.\n• In structures with moderate damage, CERT members assess the survivors as\nthey find them; however, survivors are sent to a medical treatment area a safe\ndistance from the incident.\n• CERT members are not to enter a building with heavy damage under any\ncircumstances.\nCERT volunteers should never declare or attempt to move a patient who has died. If\nyou find a deceased person (or a suspected deceased person), you should document\nthe location and notify medical personnel.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: CONDUCTING HEAD-TO-TOE ASSESSMENTS\nConducting assessments and providing rapid treatment are the first steps CERT\nvolunteers take when working with a patient.\nDuring an assessment, you should look for:\n• Severe bleeding;\n• Low body temperature; and\n• Airway obstruction.\nA head-to-toe assessment goes beyond the immediate life-threatening injuries to try to\ndetermine the nature of the patient’s injury. Perform the entire assessment before\ninitiating treatment.\nDo not conduct an assessment if a patient requires immediate care to prevent serious\ninjury or death. In these cases, CERT volunteers should administer the necessary\ntreatment before they follow up with an assessment.\nObjectives of Head-to-Toe Assessments\nThe objectives of a head-to-toe assessment are to:\n• Determine, as clearly as possible, the extent of injuries;\n• Determine what type of treatment the patient needs; and\n• Document injuries.\nRemember to wear your PPE when conducting head-to-toe assessments.\nWhat to Look for in Head-to-Toe Assessments\nThe medical community uses the acronym DCAP-BTLS to remember what to look for\nwhen conducting a rapid assessment. DCAP-BTLS stands for the following:\n• Deformities;\n• Contusions (bruising);\n• Abrasions;\n• Punctures;\n• Burns;\n• Tenderness;\n• Lacerations; and\n• Swelling.\nWhen conducting a head-to-toe assessment, CERT volunteers should look for DCAP-\nBTLS in all parts of the body.\nRemember to provide IMMEDIATE treatment for life-threatening injuries.\nPay careful attention to how people have been hurt (i.e., what caused the harm)\nbecause it provides insight to probable injuries suffered.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nHow to Conduct a Head-to-Toe Assessment\nWhenever possible, CERT volunteers should ask the person about any injuries, pain,\nbleeding, or other symptoms. If the patient is conscious, CERT members should always\nask permission to conduct the assessment. The patient has the right to refuse\ntreatment.\nBe sure to talk with the conscious patient to reduce anxiety.\nHead-to-toe assessments should be:\n• Conducted on all survivors, even those who seem all right;\n• Verbal (if the patient is able to speak); and\n• Hands-on. Do not be afraid to remove clothing to look.\nMake sure you conduct each head-to-toe assessment the same way; doing so will make\nthe procedure quicker and more accurate with each assessment. Remember to:\n• Pay careful attention;\n• Look, listen, and feel for anything unusual;\n• Suspect a spinal injury in all unconscious survivors and treat accordingly; and\n• Check your own hands for patient bleeding as you perform the head-to-toe\nassessment.\nCheck (DCAP-BTLS) body parts from the head to toe for fractured bones and soft tissue\ninjuries in the following order:",

You should minimize movement of the head and spine while\ntreating any life-threatening conditions.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nThe signs of a closed-head, neck, or spinal injury most often include:\n• Change in consciousness;\n• Inability to move one or more body parts;\n• Severe pain or pressure in head, neck, or back;\n• Tingling or numbness in extremities;\n• Difficulty breathing or seeing;\n• Heavy bleeding, bruising, or deformity of the head or spine;\n• Blood or fluid in the ears or nose;\n• Bruising behind the ear;\n• “Raccoon” eyes (bruising around eyes);\n• “Uneven” pupils;\n• Seizures; and\n• Nausea or vomiting.\nIf survivors are exhibiting any of these signs or if the survivor is found under collapsed\nbuilding material or heavy debris, you should treat them as having a closed-head, neck,\nor spinal injury.\nStabilizing the Head\nDuring a disaster, ideal equipment is rarely available. CERT members may need to be\ncreative by:\n• Looking for materials — a door, desktop, building materials — to use as a\nbackboard; and\n• Looking for items — towels, draperies, or clothing — to stabilize the head on the\nboard by tucking them snugly on either side of the head to immobilize it.\nOnly move survivors to increase the safety of the rescuer and survivor or when\nprofessional help will be delayed, and a medical treatment area is established to care\nfor multiple survivors.\n• Moving patients with suspected head, neck, or spinal injury requires sufficient\npatient stabilization. However, if the rescuer or patient is in immediate danger,\nsafety is more important than any potential spinal injury and the rescuer should\nmove the patient from the area as quickly as possible.",

CERT members and CERT programs should take measures to avoid the\nspread of disease.\nThe primary public health measures include:\n• Maintaining proper hygiene;\n• Maintaining proper sanitation;\n• Purifying water (if necessary); and\n• Preventing the spread of disease.\nMaintaining Hygiene\nThe maintenance of proper personal hygiene is critical even under makeshift conditions.\nSome steps individuals should take to maintain hygiene are listed below.\n• Wash hands frequently using soap and water. Hand washing should be thorough\n(at least 15 to 20 seconds of vigorous rubbing on all surfaces of the hand).\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizers, which do not require water, are a good alternative\nto hand washing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends\nproducts that are at least 60 percent alcohol. To use an alcohol-based hand\nsanitizer, apply about ½ teaspoon of the product to the palm of your hand. Rub\nyour hands together, covering all surfaces, until hands are dry.\n• Wear non-latex exam gloves at all times. Change or disinfect gloves after\nexamining and/or treating each patient. Under field conditions, individuals can\nuse rubber gloves if sterilized between treating survivors using bleach and water\n(one-part bleach to 10 parts water).\n• Keep dressings sterile. Do not remove the wrapping from dressings until use.\nAfter opening, use the entire package of dressing, if possible.\n• Wash any areas using soap and water or diluted bleach that come in contact with\nbody fluids.\nPractice proper hygiene techniques even during exercises.\nMaintaining Sanitation\nPoor sanitation is a major cause of infection. CERT medical operations personnel can\nmaintain sanitary conditions by following some simple steps.\n• Controlling the disposal of bacterial sources (e.g., soiled exam gloves,\ndressings).\n• Putting waste products in plastic bags, tying off the bags, and marking them as\nmedical waste. Keep medical waste separate from other trash and dispose of it\nas hazardous waste.\n• Burying human waste. Select a burial site away from the operations area and\nmark the burial site for later cleanup.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nWater Purification\nPotable water supplies are often in short supply during a disaster. Purify water for\ndrinking, cooking, and medical use by heating it to a rolling boil for 1 minute or by using\nwater purification tablets or non-perfumed liquid bleach.\nThe bleach to water ratios are:\n• 8 drops of bleach per gallon of water; and\n• 16 drops per gallon if the water is cloudy or dirty.\nLet the bleach and water solution stand for 30 minutes. Note, if the solution does not\nsmell of bleach, add another six drops of bleach and let the solution stand for 15\nminutes.\nRescuers should not put anything on wounds other than purified water. The use of other\nsolutions (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) on wounds must be the decision of trained medical\npersonnel.\nAugust 2019 Page 4-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations – Part 2 Participant Manual\nUNIT 4 SUMMARY\nThe key points of this unit are:\n• During a mass casualty incident, where the number of injured and dead\noverwhelms local resources, CERT volunteers should:\n― Identify yourself as a CERT volunteer and your local agency affiliation.\n― Assess the situation and provide life-saving interventions if a first\nresponder is not available.\n― Provide responders with detailed information from your size-up when they\narrive on scene.\n― Remember that communication is key for supporting first responders.\n• Disaster medical operations include these major functions:\n― Triage/Assessment;\n― Treatment;\n― Transport;\n― Morgue; and\n― Supply.\n• Treatment areas will take into consideration safety for rescuers and survivors and\nproximity to resources.\n• Depending on the circumstances, a first responder may establish a central\nmedical treatment location and/or treatment locations at multiple incident sites\nwith many injured survivors.\n• Head-to-toe assessments should be hands-on and verbal. Always conduct head-\nto-toe assessments in the same way—beginning with the head and moving\ntoward the feet. If you suspect injuries to the head, neck, or spine, the main\nobjective is to not cause additional injury. Use in-line stabilization and a\nbackboard if you must move the survivor.\n• To safeguard public health, take measures to maintain proper hygiene and\nsanitation, and purify water, if necessary. In advance, plan all public health\nmeasures and practice during exercises.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiar with the unit to be covered in the next session.\nTry practicing a rapid head-to-toe assessment on a friend or family member.

In responding to both natural disasters and acts of violence, CERT\nvolunteers must be prepared to deal with the psychological effects of the trauma. These\nmay include fear, anger, intense sadness, frustration, and traumatic grief. Survivors and\nCERT volunteers alike are at risk for experiencing these psychological effects.\nCERT volunteers prepare themselves for their role during and following a disaster by\nlearning about the possible emotional and physical impact of disasters on them and\nothers. This knowledge helps CERT volunteers understand and manage their reactions\nto the event while enabling them to work better with others.\nRemember what you have learned about team organization. Team organization\nconcepts can help you both operationally and psychologically. Working together and\nlooking out for each other are important aspects of successful teams.\nPsychological first aid is not therapy; rather, it is a set of techniques to provide\nemotional intervention during field operations. The techniques covered in this unit will\nhelp you manage personal situations, so you can meet the needs of all survivors,\nincluding your fellow CERT volunteers.\nUnit Objectives\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:",

Feeling unsafe and insecure.\n“Vicarious trauma” is a common occupational hazard for disaster response volunteers.\nVicarious trauma—also referred to as compassion fatigue, secondary victimization, or\nsecondary traumatic stress—is a natural reaction of an individual exposed to a\nsurvivor’s trauma. A person who identifies too strongly with a survivor may take on that\nsurvivor’s feelings.\nTaking on the survivors’ feelings as your own can affect your ability to do your job as a\nrescuer and it can have long-term impact. Taking ownership of others’ problems will\ncompound your own stress and negatively affect your overall effectiveness.\nBe alert to signs of disaster trauma in yourself, as well as in disaster survivors and\nothers, such as fellow CERT volunteers, so you can take steps to alleviate stress. The\nterm “burnout” is different from trauma. Typically, individuals suffering from burnout can\novercome it by distancing themselves from their work for a period of time.\nThe Five Fs\nHumans typically have five primary responses to stress. We refer to those as the 5 Fs:\n(1) freeze, (2) flight, (3) fight, (4) fright, and (5) faint. Our bodies have both physical and\npsychological responses to stressful events.

It is worthwhile to spend the time and\neffort to find personal stress reducers before an incident occurs.\nYou can take the following preventive steps in your everyday life.\n• Get enough sleep.\n• Exercise regularly.\n• Eat a balanced diet.\n• Balance work, play, and rest.\n• Allow yourself to receive as well as give; you should remember that your identity\nis broader than that of a helper.\n• Connect with others.\n• Use spiritual resources.\nIn addition to preventive steps, you should explain to your loved ones and friends how\nto support you when you return from a disaster area.\n• Listen when you want to talk.\n• Do not force you to talk if you are not ready\nYou may also want to share with your loved ones and friends the information on\npossible disaster-related psychological and physiological symptoms discussed earlier.\nExercise 5.1: Self-Care Toolbox\nPurpose: This activity is to provide you with the opportunity to outline a number of self-\ncare tools that you can perform both before and during a crisis so that you are ready to\nrespond during an emergency.\nInstructions: Complete this activity individually and at your own pace.

Sharing the workload and emotional load\ncan help defuse pent-up emotions.\n• Encourage rescuers to rest and regroup to avoid becoming overtired.\n• Direct rescuers to take breaks away from the incident area for relief from the\nstress of the effort.\n• Establish a culture of acceptance amongst the team. Encourage volunteers to\nverbalize their experiences and normalize open communication.\n• Encourage rescuers to eat properly and maintain fluid intake during the\noperation. Encourage them to drink water or other electrolyte-replacing fluids,\navoiding drinks with caffeine or refined sugar.\n• Encourage volunteers to be aware of changes in their teammates that may\nindicate personal stress and the need for a break or change of assignment.\n• Rotate teams for breaks or new duties (e.g., from high-stress to low-stress jobs).\nEncourage volunteers to talk with each other about their experiences to promote\npsychological health.\n• Do not send home volunteers who just completed a high-stress operation;\ninstead, assign them to a low-stress responsibility so they can decompress\ngradually.\n• Conduct a brief discussion with rescue workers after their shift during which they\ncan describe and express their feelings about what they encountered.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: WORKING WITH SURVIVORS’ EMOTIONAL\nRESPONSES\nCrisis survivors can go through a variety of emotional phases, and as a rescuer, you\nshould be aware of what you may encounter. The conditions associated with evacuation\nand relocation have psychological significance. When there are physical hazards or\nfamily separations during the evacuation process, survivors often experience post-\ntraumatic reactions. When the family unit is not together due to shelter requirements or\nother factors, anxiety regarding the welfare of those not present may detract from the\nattention necessary for immediate problem solving.\n• Pre-Disaster Phase: Communities will have varying degrees of warning\ndepending on the type of disaster. For example, earthquakes typically hit without\nwarning; whereas, hurricanes and floods typically strike within hours to days of a\nwarning. When there is no warning, survivors may feel more vulnerable, unsafe,\nand fearful of future unpredicted tragedies. The perception they had no control\nover protecting themselves or their loved ones can be deeply distressing.\nMeanwhile, when people do not heed warnings and suffer losses as a result,\nthey may experience guilt and self-blame. While they may have specific plans for\nhow they might protect themselves in the future, survivors often feel guilty or\nresponsible for what has occurred.\n• Impact Phase: The impact phase of a disaster varies from the slow, low threat\nbuildup associated with some types of floods to the violent, dangerous, and\ndestructive outcomes associated with tornadoes and explosions. The greater the\nscope, community destruction, and personal losses associated with the disaster,\nthe greater the psychosocial effects.\nDepending on the characteristics of the incident, people's reactions may range\nfrom constricted, stunned, shock-like responses to the less common overt\nexpressions of panic and hysteria. Typically, people respond initially with\nconfusion and disbelief and focus on the survival and physical well-being of\nthemselves and their loved ones. When families are in different geographic\nlocations during the impact of a disaster (e.g., children at school, adults at work),\nsurvivors will experience considerable anxiety until reunification.\n• Heroic Phase: In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, survival, rescuing\nothers, and promoting safety are priorities. Evacuation to shelters, motels, or\nother homes may be necessary. For some, post-impact disorientation gives way\nto adrenaline-induced rescue behavior to save lives and protect property. While\nactivity level may be high, actual productivity is often low. The capacity to assess\nrisk may be impaired, and injuries can result. Altruism is prominent among both\nsurvivors and emergency responders.\n• Honeymoon Phase: In the weeks and months following a disaster, formal\ngovernmental and volunteer assistance may be readily available. Community\nbonding occurs from the shared experience of surviving a catastrophic\nexperience and the giving and receiving of community support. Survivors may\nexperience a short-lived sense of optimism that the help they will receive will\nmake them “whole” again. When disaster behavioral health workers are visible\nAugust 2019 Page 5-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nand perceived as helpful during this phase, they are more readily accepted and\nhave a foundation from which to aid in the difficult phases ahead.\n• Disillusionment Phase: Disappointment in a slower-than-expected pace of\nrecovery can trigger this phase. Disillusionment typically occurs in the second\nhalf of the year immediately following a disaster and, again, after the disaster’s\nfirst anniversary.\n• Reconstruction Phase: The reconstruction of physical property and recovery of\nemotional well-being may continue for years following a disaster. At this point,\nsurvivors have realized they will need to solve the problems of rebuilding their\nown homes, businesses, and lives largely by themselves and have gradually\nassumed the responsibility for doing so.\nTraumatic Crisis\nA traumatic crisis is an event experienced or witnessed in which people’s ability to cope\nis overwhelmed by:\n• Actual or potential death or injury to self or others;\n• Serious injury;\n• Destruction of their homes, neighborhood, or valued possessions; and/or\n• Loss of contact with family volunteers or close friends.\nTraumatic stress may affect:\n• Cognitive Function: Those who have suffered traumatic stress may act\nirrationally, in ways out of character for them, and they may have difficulty\nmaking decisions. Additionally, they may have difficulty sharing or retrieving\nmemories.\n• Physical Health: Traumatic stress can cause physical symptoms and health\nproblems.\n• Interpersonal Relationships: Survivors of traumatic stress may undergo\ntemporary or long-term personality changes that make interpersonal relationships\ndifficult.\nMediating Factors\nThe strength and type of personal reaction to trauma vary depending on a combination\nof the following factors:\n• A person’s prior experience with the same or a similar event; the emotional effect\nof multiple events can be cumulative, leading to greater stress reactions.\n• Intensity of the disruption in the survivors’ lives; the more the survivors’ lives are\ndisrupted, the greater their psychological and physiological reactions may\nbecome.\n• The meaning of the event to the individual; the more catastrophic the victim\nperceives the event to be to him or her personally, the more intense his or her\nstress reaction will be.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\n• The emotional well-being of the individual and the resources (especially social)\nthat he or she has to cope. People who have had other recent traumas may not\ncope well with additional stresses.\n• The length of time that has elapsed between the event’s occurrence and the\npresent; the reality of the event takes time to “sink in.”\nCERT volunteers cannot know—and should never assume to know—what someone is\nthinking or feeling.\nDo not take the survivors’ surface attitudes personally. Rescuers should expect to see a\nrange of responses that will vary from person to person, but the responses they see will\nbe part of the psychological impact of the event—and probably will not relate to anything\nthat the CERTs have or have not done.\nStabilizing Survivors\nThe goal of on-scene psychological intervention on the part of CERT volunteers should\nbe to calm the incident scene by stabilizing individuals. Address any medical needs then\nuse the methods below to psychologically stabilize individuals.\n• Observe survivors to determine their level of responsiveness and decide whether\nthey pose a danger to themselves or to others.\n• Get uninjured people involved in helping. Engaging survivors in focused activity\nhelps them cope. Give them constructive jobs to do such as organizing supplies.\nThis strategy is especially effective for survivors who are being disruptive.\nProvide support by:\n• Listening: Let them talk about their feelings and their physical needs. Survivors\noften need to talk about what they have been through – and they may want\nsomeone to listen to them.\n• Empathizing: Caring responses show survivors that someone else shares their\nfeelings of pain and grief.\n• Connecting: Help survivors connect to natural support systems, such as family,\nfriends, or clergy.\nListen, Protect, Connect\nPsychological First Aid (PFA) is an evidence-informed approach to assist children,\nadolescents, adults, and families in a disaster’s aftermath. Just as you learned basic\nfirst aid in Units 3 and 4 to support the physical needs of survivors, PFA provides the\ninitial support for survivors’ psychological well-being. “Listen, Protect, Connect” is one\nmethod of PFA that can assist survivors in taking steps to bounce back more quickly.\n• Listen: The first important step to help your survivors after an event is to listen\nand pay attention to what they say (and how they say it), how they act, and what\nthey need right now. We talked previously about the many ways in which people\nmay react after experiencing a traumatic event. Remember that not all reactions\nare verbal or can be seen.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nLet the survivor(s) know you are willing to listen and talk about the event when or\nif they would like to. Understand that sometimes survivors are not ready to talk or\ndo not want to talk and that is okay. Check back with them on a regular basis to\nsee if their reactions or needs have changed.\n• Protect: This step helps survivors feel protected and allows you to protect them\nfrom added stress. This step helps survivors feel better by taking actions to\nprovide support, encouragement, and reassurance. The listening step should\nhave provided you with enough information to make informed decisions about\neach survivor’s needs.\n― Provide information or resources.\n― Answer questions simply and honestly, clearing up any confusion they\nmay have.\n― Empathize and let them know they are not alone in their reactions to the\nevent.\n― Provide opportunities for them to communicate, but do not force them.\n― Talk to them about what is being done to keep everyone safe from harm.\n― Watch for anything in the environment that could re-traumatize them such\nas sights, smells, or sounds and help them reduce contact with those\nelements.\n― Help them decide what their basic needs are and how to get access to\nthem (e.g., encouraging healthy behaviors such as food and rest).\n• Connect: Connecting survivors to their friends, loved ones, and other resources\nhas a positive impact on their recovery.\n― Assist survivors in reconnecting with friends or loved ones after a disaster.\n― Ensure you are connecting with them on a regular basis.\n― Help them find access to resources that can offer support.\nBeing an Empathetic Listener\nBeing an empathetic listener requires the listener to listen and to let the survivor talk.\nGood listeners will:\n• Put the listener in the speaker’s shoes to understand the speaker’s point of view\nmore profoundly. Draw upon experiences or try to imagine how the speaker is\nfeeling. To limit the effects of vicarious trauma, be careful not to completely take\non the speaker’s feelings.\n• Listen for meaning, not just words, and pay close attention to the speaker’s\nnonverbal communication, such as body language, facial expressions, and tone\nof voice.\n• Paraphrase the speaker periodically to make sure he or she fully understood\nwhat the speaker said and to indicate to the speaker that you are listening. This\nreinforces the communication process.\nSurvivors can show evidence of being suicidal, psychotic, or unable to care for\nthemselves. Be sure to refer these cases to EMS and/or mental health professionals for\nsupport as soon as possible.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nWhat Not to Say\nWhen providing support, you should avoid saying the following phrases. On the surface,\nyou may say these phrases to comfort the survivors, but they can be misinterpreted or\nnot well received. In general, avoid the statements below:\n• “I understand.” In most situations, we cannot understand unless we have had the\nsame experience.\n• “Don’t feel bad.” The survivor has a right to feel bad and will need time to feel\ndifferently.\n• “You’re strong” or “You’ll get through this.” Many survivors do not feel strong and\nquestion if they will recover from the loss.\n• “Don’t cry.” It is okay to cry.\n• “It’s God’s will.” With a person you do not know, giving religious meaning to an\nevent may insult or anger the person.\n• “It could be worse,” “At least you still have…”, or “Everything will be okay.” It is up\nto the individual to decide whether things could be worse or if everything will be\nokay.\nRather than provide comfort, these types of responses could elicit a strong negative\nresponse or distance the survivor from the listener.\nIt is okay to apologize if the survivor reacts negatively to something you said.\nLearn to be comfortable with silence. Do not say something just to alleviate your own\ndiscomfort.\nSay This Instead\nAlways ask permission to enter their space, provide help, or interact with them.\nAllow people to say what they need. Normalize what they are feeling and thinking using\ncommon phrases similar to those below.\n• “I’m sorry for your pain.”\n• “I’m so sorry this has happened.”\n• “Is it all right if I help you with…?”\n• “I can’t imagine what this is like for you.”\n• “What do you need?”\nManaging Death Scene\nOne unpleasant task that CERT volunteers may face is dealing with a victim who dies\nwhile under the team’s care. The guidelines below are useful for dealing with this\nsituation.\n• Cover the body; treat it with respect.\n• Follow local laws and protocols for handling the deceased.\n• Talk with local authorities to determine the plan.\nAugust 2019 Page 5-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 5: Disaster Psychology Participant Manual\nUNIT 5 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• A disaster may expose rescuers to extremely unpleasant or uncomfortable\nsituations. These experiences will be stressful and may be traumatic.\n• Over-identifying with survivors may subject rescuers to vicarious trauma.\n• Survivors and rescuers may have both psychological and physiological\nsymptoms of trauma after a disaster.\n• CERT leaders can take steps to reduce stress on rescue workers before, during,\nand after an incident.\n• CERT volunteers can take steps to reduce stress on themselves.\n• Psychological First Aid is an evidence-informed approach for assisting children,\nadolescents, adults, and families in the aftermath of disaster.\n• The steps listen, protect, and connect can provide actions associated with\nsupporting survivors after a disaster.\n• Research shows that survivors go through the following distinct emotional\nphases following a disaster:\n― Pre-Disaster\n― Impact\n― Heroic\n― Honeymoon\n― Disillusionment\n― Reconstruction\n• Traumatic stress may affect cognitive functioning, physical health, and\ninterpersonal reactions.\n• Different people react differently to traumatic stress based on a variety of\nmediating factors.\n• A traumatic crisis occurs when a person’s ability to cope is overwhelmed.\n• The goal of on-scene psychological intervention is to stabilize the incident by\nstabilizing individuals.\n• Provide support for survivors by being an empathetic listener.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiarize

Identify and reduce potential fire, utility, and hazardous materials hazards at\nhome and in the community.\nRole of CERTs\nCERTs play a very important role in fire and utility safety by supporting the following\nactions.\n• Extinguishing small fires before they become major fires.\n― This unit will provide training on how to use an extinguisher to put out\nsmall fires and how to recognize when a fire is too big to handle. As a rule,\nif you cannot put out a fire in five seconds, it is already too big to handle,\nand you should leave the premises immediately.\n• Preventing additional fires by removing fuel sources.\n― This unit will describe how to perform an “overhaul,” the process to ensure\nyou extinguish a fire completely and permanently.\n• Shutting off utilities when necessary and safe to do so.\n― This unit will review utility shutoff procedures taught in Unit 1.\n• Assisting with evacuations where necessary.\n― When a fire is beyond the ability of CERTs to extinguish or a utility\nemergency has occurred, CERT volunteers need to protect lives by\nevacuating the area and establishing a perimeter, while also notifying fire\nservices of the situation.\nCERT Priorities\nCERTs play a very important role in neighborhood and workplace fire and utility safety.\nCERT volunteers help in fire- and utility-related emergencies before professional\nresponders arrive. When responding, CERT volunteers should keep in mind the\nfollowing CERT standards:\nRescuer safety is always the number one priority. Therefore, CERT volunteers should\nalways:\n• Use the buddy system. Buddies serve an important purpose. They protect your\nsafety. Do not ever try to fight a fire alone. Stick together at all times.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\n• Wear safety equipment (gloves, helmet, goggles, N95 mask, and sturdy shoes or\nboots). Unless otherwise stated, this equipment is generally not fire-resistant\nPPE.\n• The CERT goal is to do the greatest good for the greatest number.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: FIRE CHEMISTRY\nThe Fire Triangle\nFire requires three elements to exist:\n• Heat: Heat is required to elevate the temperature of a material to its ignition\npoint.\n• Fuel: The fuel for a fire may be a solid, liquid, or gas. The type and quantity of\nthe fuel will determine which method you should use to extinguish the fire.\n• Oxygen: Most fires will burn vigorously in any atmosphere of at least 20 percent\noxygen. Without oxygen, most fuels could be heated until entirely consumed yet\nthey would not burn.\nThese three elements, called the fire triangle, create a chemical exothermic reaction,\nwhich is fire.\nImage 6.1: Fire Triangle\nClasses of Fires\nTo aid in distinguishing types of fires, fires are categorized into classes based on the\ntype of fuel that is burning.\n• Class A Fires: Ordinary combustibles, such as paper, cloth, wood, rubber, and\nmany plastics.\n• Class B Fires: Flammable liquids, including oils and gasoline as well as\ncombustible liquids such as charcoal lighter fluid and kerosene. Only the vapor\nburns when ignited.\n• Class C Fires: Energized electrical equipment, such as wires and motors. When\nthe electricity is turned off, the fire becomes a Class A fire.\n• Class D Fires: Combustible metals, including aluminum, magnesium, and\ntitanium.\n• Class K Fires: Cooking oils, such as vegetable oils, animal oils, and fats.\nIt is extremely important to identify the type of fuel feeding the fire in order to select the\ncorrect method and agent for extinguishing the fire.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: FIRE SIZE-UP CONSIDERATIONS\nAs introduced in Unit 2, size-up is a continual process that enables professional\nresponders to make decisions and respond appropriately in the areas of greatest need.\nCERT size-up consists of nine steps and should be used in any emergency, including\nduring fire situations.\nSize-up of a situation involving a fire will dictate whether to attempt fire suppression and\nwill help you plan for extinguishing the fire.\nThe safety of individual CERT volunteers is always the top priority. An effective fire size-\nup will allow participants to answer all of the following questions:\n• Do my buddy and I have the right equipment?\n• Are there other hazards?\n• Is the building structurally damaged?\n• Can my buddy and I escape?\n• Can my buddy and I fight the fire safely?\nTable 6.1: CERT Fire Size-up\nStep 1: Gather Facts\nTime\nDoes the time of day or week affect fire suppression efforts?\nYes No\nHow?\nWeather\nAre there weather conditions that affect your safety? If yes,\nYes No\nhow will your safety be affected?\nWill weather conditions affect the situation? If yes, how will the\nYes No\nsituation be affected?\nType of Construction\nWhat type(s) of structure(s) is (are) involved?\nWhat type(s) of construction is (are) involved?\nOccupancy\nAre the structures occupied? If yes, how many people are likely\nYes No\nto be affected?\nAre there special considerations (e.g. children, elderly, pets,\nYes No\npeople with access and functional needs)?\nHazards\nAre hazardous materials evident? Yes No\nAre any other types of hazards involved? Is yes, what other\nYes No\nhazards?\nAugust 2019 Page 6-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nStep 2: Assess and Communicate the Damage\nSurvey all sides of the scene. Is the danger beyond the\nYes No\nCERT’s capability?\nHave the facts and the initial damage assessment been\nYes No\ncommunicated to the appropriate person(s)?\nStep 3: Consider Possibilities\nLife Hazards\nAre there potentially life-threatening hazards? If yes, what are\nYes No\nthe hazards?\nPath of Fire\nDoes the path of the fire jeopardize other areas? If yes, what\nYes No\nother areas may be in jeopardy?\nAdditional Damage\nIs there a high potential for more disaster activity that will\nYes No\nimpact personal safety? If yes, what are the known risks?\nStep 4: Assess Your Own Situation\nWhat equipment is available to help suppress the fire?\nWhat other resources are available?\nCan CERT volunteers safely attempt to suppress the fire? If\nYes No\nnot, do not attempt suppression.\nStep 5: Establish Priorities\nAre there any other more pressing needs now? If yes, list. Yes No\nStep 6: Make Decisions\nWhere will resources do the most good while maintaining an adequate margin of\nsafety?\nStep 7: Develop Plan of Action\nDetermine how personnel and other resources should be used.\nStep 8: Take Action\nPut the plan into effect.\nStep 9: Evaluate Progress\nContinually size up the situation to identify changes in the scope of the problem,\nsafety risks, and resources availability.\nAdjust strategies as required.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSize-up is a continuous process. Evaluation of progress—Step 9—may require you to\ngo back and gather additional facts.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES\nThe most common firefighting resources are:\n• Local fire departments;\n• Fire alarm systems;\n• Sprinkler systems;\n• Portable fire extinguishers; and\n• Interior wet standpipes (water hoses found in commercial or residential buildings,\nnot for public use).\nFire Extinguishers\nPortable fire extinguishers are invaluable for putting out small fires. A well-prepared\nhome should have multiple portable fire extinguishers (locations could include kitchen,\ngarage, workshop space, and basements). Workplaces are governed by regulation or\nfire code and should have the appropriate number of fire extinguishers as defined by\nregulation or fire code.\nKeep in mind that the type of fuel that is burning will determine which resources to\nselect to fight a fire.\nTypes of Fire Extinguishers\nThere are four types of extinguishers:",

Extinguishers appropriate for Class A fires have a rating from 1A to 40A,\nwith a higher number indicating a higher volume of extinguishing agent. Extinguishers\nappropriate for Class B fires have a rating from 1B to 640B. No number accompanies\nan extinguisher rated Class C, D, or K. The C on the label indicates only that the\nextinguisher is safe to use on electrical fires. Manufacturers label extinguishers for\nClass D fires to match the type of metal that is burning and with a list detailing the\nmetals that match the unit’s extinguishing agent. The extinguishers for Class K fires\nsupplement fire suppression systems in commercial kitchens. They spray an alkaline\nmixture that, when combined with the fatty acid of the burning cooking oil or fat, creates\nsoapy foam to hold in the vapors and extinguish the fire.\nImage 6.2: Manufacturer’s Label Illustration\nSample manufacturer’s label for a fire extinguisher, showing the Underwriters Laboratories\nsymbol at the top, the type and classification of fire extinguisher, testing procedures used, and\nserial number. At the bottom of the label is marine information, including the U.S. Coast Guard\napproval number.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nWater Extinguishers\nCommon characteristics of water extinguishers include:\n• Capacity: Standard size is 2.5 gallons.\n• Range: Standard range is 30-40 feet.\n• Pressure: Standard pressure is 110 pounds per square inch (psi).\nUse extreme caution when using a water extinguisher to ensure the water, which is\nunder pressure, does not scatter lightweight materials and spread the fire.\nChemical Extinguishers\nDry chemical extinguishers are most common.\n• Dry chemical extinguishers have a sodium bicarbonate base and are effective on\nClass B and C fires.\n• Multipurpose dry chemical extinguishers have a monoammonium phosphate\nbase and are effective for Class A, B, and C fires.\nCommon characteristics of dry chemical extinguishers include:\n• Capacity: Approximately 10-20 seconds discharge time\n• Range: Standard range is 8-12 feet.\n• Pressure: Standard pressure is 175-250 psi.\nWhile still in use, carbon dioxide and other specialized extinguishers are becoming less\ncommon.\nDeciding to Use a Fire Extinguisher\nThere is a series of questions to ask before attempting to fight a fire with a fire\nextinguisher:\n• Are there two ways to exit the area quickly and safely if I attempt to extinguish\nthe fire?\n• Do I have the right type of extinguisher for the type of fire?\n• Is the extinguisher large enough for the fire?\n• Is the area free from other dangers, such as hazardous materials and falling\ndebris?\n• Am I experienced or trained in the use of a fire extinguisher?\nIf you answer “NO” to any of these questions or if you have been unable to put out the\nfire in five seconds using the extinguisher, you should:\n• Leave the building immediately (activate fire alarm system if it is safe to do so);\n• While leaving, shut all doors to slow the spread of the fire; and\n• Contact local fire department.\nIf you answer “YES” to all of these questions, you may attempt to extinguish the fire.\nEven if you answer “YES” to all of the questions but feel unable to extinguish the fire,\nyou should leave immediately. You should always remember the five-second rule.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nIf the fire is extinguished in five seconds and the area is safe, you should stay and\noverhaul the fire. Overhauling is the process of searching a fire scene for hidden fire or\nsparks in an effort to prevent the fire from rekindling. Remember “cool, soak, and\nseparate.”\nIt is always a good idea to contact your local fire department even if you were able to\nextinguish a small fire. Fire department personnel will be able to assist with properly\noverhauling and ensuring that you extinguished the fire completely. In addition,\ninsurance companies or workplace management (depending on your location) may\nwant a report to have on file regarding the incident, especially if there is any damage.\nImage 6.3: Deciding to Use a Fire Extinguisher\nImage 6.4: Components of a Portable Fire Extinguisher\nComponents of a portable fire extinguisher: hose, carrying handle\nand trigger, pressure gauge, and cylinder.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nP.A.S.S.\nThe acronym for operating a fire extinguisher is P.A.S.S.:\n• Pull (Test the extinguisher after pulling the pin.);\n• Aim;\n• Squeeze; and\n• Sweep.\nTo ensure the extinguisher is working properly, test it before approaching any fire.\nBe sure to aim at the base of the fire; it is important to extinguish the fuel, not the\nflames.\nAny fire extinguishers that have been completely depleted should be laid down and\nstored on their side so no attempt will be made to use them until they are recharged.\nImage 6.5: P.A.S.S.\nInterior Wet Standpipes\nInterior wet standpipes are usually in commercial and apartment buildings and consist\nof 100 feet of 1.5-inch jacketed hose with an adjustable spray nozzle. They deliver at\nleast 100 gallons of water per minute. Because of the size of the hose and the volume\nof water discharged, interior wet sandpipes can be difficult to manage. Therefore, CERT\nvolunteers should never operate interior wet standpipes.\nConfinement\nIn interior spaces, it is possible to confine a fire and restrict the spread of smoke and\nheat by closing interior and exterior doors.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: FIRE SUPPRESSION SAFETY\nSmall fire suppression may be one of your roles as a CERT volunteer. Your personal\nsafety must always be your number one concern. You will be unable to help anyone if\nyou have injured yourself through careless size-up or unsafe acts.\nFire Suppression Safety Rules\nVolunteers should follow all rules regarding fire suppression safety.\n• Use safety equipment at all times. Wear your helmet, goggles, dust mask, leather\ngloves, and sturdy shoes or boots. If you are not equipped to protect your\npersonal safety, leave the building.\n• Work with a buddy. Buddies serve an important purpose. They protect your\nsafety. Do not ever try to fight a fire alone. Stick together at all times.\n• Have a backup team, whenever possible. A backup team can support your fire\nsuppression efforts and can provide help if you need it.\n• Always have two ways to exit the fire area. Fires spread much faster than you\nmight think. Always have a backup escape plan in case your main escape route\nbecomes blocked.\n• Look at the door. If air is being sucked under the door or smoke is seeping out\nthe top of the door, do not touch or open the door.\n• Feel closed doors with the back of the hand, working from the bottom of the door\nup including the space between the door and its frame. Do not touch the door\nhandle before feeling the door. If the door is hot, there is fire behind it. Do not\nenter! Opening the door will feed additional oxygen to the fire.\n• Confine the fire, whenever possible, by closing doors and keeping them closed.\n• Stay low to the ground. Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of fire-related\ndeaths. Smoke will naturally rise and keeping low to the ground will provide you\nwith fresher air to breathe.\n• Maintain a safe distance. Remember the effective range of your fire extinguisher.\nDo not get closer than necessary to extinguish the fire.\n• Never turn your back on a fire when backing out.\n• Overhaul the fire to be sure that it is extinguished—and stays extinguished.\nSometimes, what CERTs should not do when suppressing fires is just as important as\nwhat they should do.\n• DO NOT get too close. Stay near the outer range of your extinguisher. If you feel\nthe heat, you are too close.\n• DO NOT try to fight a fire alone. Remember your first priority is your personal\nsafety. Do not put it at risk.\n• DO NOT try to suppress large fires. Learn the capability of your equipment, and\ndo not try to suppress a fire that is clearly too large for the equipment at hand\n(e.g., a fire that is larger than the combined ratings of available fire\nextinguishers).\n• DO NOT enter smoke-filled areas. Suppressing fires in smoke-filled areas\nrequires equipment that CERTs do not have.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nProper Fire Suppression Procedures\nRemember: CERT volunteers should use the buddy system in all cases. The job of\nTeam Member 1 is to put out a fire with an extinguisher. Meanwhile, the job of Team\nMember 2 is to watch for hazards and ensure the safety of both team members.

Most of\nthese hazards fall into the following categories:\n• Electrical hazards;\n• Natural gas hazards; or\n• Flammable or combustible liquids.\nHomes and workplaces can and do have other hazards, including incompatible\nmaterials stored in close proximity to each other, such as flammables/combustibles,\ncorrosives, compressed gases, and explosives. Simple fire prevention measures will\nhelp reduce the likelihood of fires:\n• First, locate potential sources of ignition; then\n• Do what you can to reduce or eliminate the hazards.\nElectrical Hazards\nHere are some examples of common electrical hazards and simple ways CERT\nvolunteers can reduce or eliminate them, such as:\n• Avoid the “electrical octopus.” Eliminate tangles of electrical cords.\n• Do not overload electrical outlets.\n• Do not plug power strips into other power strips.\n• Do not run electrical cords under carpets.\n• Check for and replace broken or frayed cords\n• Maintain electrical appliances. Repair or replace malfunctioning appliances.\nResponding to Electrical Emergencies\nElectrical emergencies sometimes occur despite our best efforts. In the event of an\nelectrical emergency, first responders, and even knowledgeable members of the\nhousehold can take the following steps:\n• Locate the circuit breakers or fuses and know how to shut off the power. Post\nshutoff instructions next to the breaker box or fuse box.\n• Unscrew individual fuses or switch off smaller breakers first, then pull the main\nswitch or breaker.\n• When turning the power back on, turn on the main switch or breaker first, then\nscrew in the fuses or switch on the smaller breakers, one at a time.\nBe certain to notify a licensed electrician and/or utility company in the event of an\nelectrical emergency or fire.\nYou should not enter a flooded basement or wade into standing water to shut off the\nelectrical supply because water conducts electricity.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nImage 6.6: Circuit Box and Fuse Box\nNatural Gas Hazards\nNatural gas presents two types of hazards. It is an asphyxiant, which displaces oxygen\nin the body, and it is flammable meaning it can readily ignite under the right conditions\nIt is important to recognize that natural gas is lighter than air, and to understand that you\nwill likely not be able to feel the gas in the event of a leak. Therefore, you should place\nnatural gas detectors as you would smoke alarms, strategically on every level of your\nhome. Common places to place natural gas detectors are near the furnace, hot water\ntank, and other gas appliances such as a clothes dryer or stove. Test the detector\nmonthly to ensure it works.\nCarbon Monoxide\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly, colorless, odorless, poisonous gas that, like natural\ngas, is lighter than air. The incomplete burning of various fuels, including natural gas, is\nresponsible for producing CO. Malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces,\nranges, water heaters and room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable\ngenerators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas\nare at risk for producing CO.\nTo prevent CO poisoning, install carbon monoxide detectors, which meet the current\nsafety standards near all separate sleeping areas. You should install additional\ndetectors on every level of the home and in every bedroom. Do not place detectors\nwithin 15 feet of heating or cooking appliances or in or near very humid areas such as\nbathrooms. Test the detector monthly to ensure it works.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nNatural Gas Shutoff\nLocate and clearly label the gas shutoff valve(s). There may be multiple valves inside a\nhome in addition to the main shutoff. Know how to shut off the gas and have the proper\nnon-sparking tool for shutting off the gas. If you are unsure of how to shut off the gas\nproperly and safely, you should never attempt to do so. Contact your local gas company\nfor assistance.\nImage 6.7: Natural Gas Meter with Shutoff\nThe gas meter shutoff diagram indicates the shutoff valve location on the pipe that comes out of\nthe ground. To turn off the valve, use a non-sparking wrench to turn the valve clockwise one-\nquarter turn. Remember that, in all cases, only a licensed technician should turn on natural gas\nflow.\nPlease note: Some gas meters have automatic shutoff valves that restrict the flow of\ngas during an earthquake or other emergency. A licensed plumber installs these,\ndownstream of the utility point of delivery. If you are unsure whether your home has this\nshutoff device, contact your gas service company. If this shutoff device is closed, only a\nqualified professional should restore it.\nGas Meter Inside the Home\nIf your gas meter is located inside your home, you should only shut off the gas flow\nwhen instructed to by local authorities. If you smell gas or see the dials on your meter\nshowing gas is flowing even though your appliances are off, you should evacuate the\npremises and call 9-1-1. Do not attempt to shut off the gas from inside the building if gas\nmay be in the air.\nGas Meter Outside the Home\nYou should turn off the meter from outside the building if you smell gas or you see dials\non the meter showing gas is flowing even though appliances are off. If there is a fire you\ncannot extinguish, call 9-1-1 and turn off the gas only if it is safe to do so.\nNever enter the basement of a structure that is on fire to turn off any utility. Be sure to\nuse a flashlight, not a candle, if you need additional light to locate and shut off the gas\nvalve.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nIf you are unsure of the proper procedures, do not attempt to turn the utilities on again\nyourself, particularly in multiple-unit dwellings. Always follow your local fire department’s\nguidelines. Remember that, in all cases, after the natural gas has been shut off, only a\ntrained technician can restore it. Inappropriate or abrupt engagement of gas service\nmay cause gas leaks inside the house.\nFlammable Liquid Hazards\nTips for reducing hazards from flammable liquids:\n• Read labels to identify flammable products; and\n• Store them properly, using the L.I.E.S. method (Limit, Isolate, Eliminate,\nSeparate).\nIf you need to use a fire extinguisher, you should only extinguish a flammable liquid\nusing a portable fire extinguisher rated for Class B fires.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nSECTION 7: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS\nMaterials are considered hazardous if they have any of these characteristics:\n• Corrode other materials;\n• Explode or are easily ignited;\n• React strongly with water;\n• Are unstable when exposed to heat or shock; and\n• Are otherwise toxic to humans, animals, or the environment through absorption,\ninhalation, injection, or ingestion.\nHazardous materials include, but are not limited to:\n• Explosives;\n• Flammable gases and liquids;\n• Poisons and poisonous gases;\n• Corrosives;\n• Nonflammable gases;\n• Oxidizers; and\n• Radioactive materials.\nIdentifying Hazardous Materials Locations\nThere are several ways to identify locations where hazardous materials are stored,\nused, or in transit.\n• Location and type of occupancy;\n• Placards and labels; and\n• Sights, sounds, and smells.\nLocation and Type of Occupancy\nHazardous materials are commonplace throughout every community. Many commercial\nprocesses rely on hazardous materials and many retail outlets sell them. Despite\nprotections in place, accidents and disasters can occur, causing these materials to\nrelease into the environment. Common locations in the community can include:\n• Industrial locations, such as a warehouse, rail yard, or shipyard;\n• Household locations, including under kitchen/bathroom sinks, workshop cabinets,\ngarages, basements;\n• Dry cleaner;\n• Funeral home;\n• Home supply store;\n• Big box store; and\n• Delivery van, such as overnight delivery services.\nPlacards\nWarning placards are required whenever large amounts of hazardous materials are\nbeing stored, used, or transported. These placards act as an immediate warning system\nAugust 2019 Page 6-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nfor emergency responders, helping them identify the kinds of materials present and the\ndangers they pose.\nCERT volunteers should consider these placards a “stop sign.”\nNational Fire Protection Association\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 704 Diamond is a concise system for\nidentifying the hazards associated with specific materials. CERT volunteers will find the\nNFPA 704 Diamond placard on fixed facilities where hazardous materials are used or\nstored.\nThe diamond is divided into four colored quadrants, each with a rating number inside of\nit, which indicates the degree of risk associated with the material. Numbers range from\n0 to 4. The higher the number the higher the risk!\nImage 6.8: NFPA 704 Diamond\n• The red quadrant describes the material’s flammability.\n• The blue quadrant indicates health hazard.\n• The yellow quadrant indicates reactivity.\n• The white quadrant indicates special precautions.\nThere are two symbols specified in the National Fire Codes, section 704.\n• W indicates a material that displays unusual reactivity with water (e.g., should\nnever be mixed with water or have water sprayed on it). Magnesium metal is an\nexample of a material that is reactive to water.\n• OX indicates a material that possesses oxidizing properties. Ammonium nitrate is\nan example of a material with oxidizing properties. Materials that are oxidizers\nincrease the potential for explosion or fire.\nIn addition to the above symbols that are specified under the National Fire Codes, some\nNFPA 704 Diamonds will include additional symbols:\n• ACID indicates that the material is an acid.\n• ALK indicates that the material is a base.\n• COR indicates that the material is corrosive.\n• indicates that the material is radioactive.\nThe numbers within the NFPA 704 Diamond are used to assist professional firefighters\nin responding to accidents or fires.\nAugust 2019 Page 6-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nThe only action CERT volunteers should take is to evacuate persons who are\ndownwind, as necessary, to an uphill or upwind location. Do not enter the building to\nevacuate people inside.\nGlobal Harmonized System\nThe Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) is\na system developed by the United Nations as a voluntary international system for\nchemical hazard communication. The GHS includes methods for classifying all\nhazardous chemical substances and mixtures.\nThere are three standard elements to a GHS safety label.\n• Symbols use pictograms to communicate physical, health, and environmental\nhazard information.\n• Signal Words indicate the severity of the hazard. “Danger” is used for severe\nhazards and “Warning” is used for less severe hazards. For lower level hazards,\na signal word is not used.\n• Hazard Statements are standardized phrases that describe each hazard\npresented by a chemical substance or mixture.\nImage 6.9: GHS Pictograms\nAugust 2019 Page 6-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nGHS labels also include the following additional elements:\n• Precautionary Statements and Pictograms provide information to minimize or\nprevent the effects from a hazard;\n• Product Identifiers, or the name or number used on a product’s safety data sheet;\n• Supplier Identification includes the name, address, and telephone number of the\nproduct’s manufacturer or supplier; and\n• Supplemental Information is additional, non-harmonized information that is not\nrequired or specified under the GHS.\nIdentifying Hazardous Materials in Transit\nThere are three ways that hazardous materials are marked and identified while in\ntransit:",

Like the NFPA 704 Diamond,\nthe DOT, UN, and NA placards should be a “stop sign” for CERT volunteers. You\nshould always err on the side of safety. You should not assume that, because there is\nno placard, no hazardous materials are present. Treat any unknown situation as a\nhazardous materials incident.\n• No placard is required for less than 1,000 pounds of many hazardous materials.\n• Certain hazardous materials (e.g., anhydrous ammonia) are placarded as a\nnonflammable gas for domestic transport but as a flammable gas for international\ntransport. (Anhydrous ammonia is a flammable gas!)\n• Sometimes drivers forget to change the placard when they change their cargo.\nCERT volunteers should use extreme caution when approaching any vehicle in\nan accident.\nImage 6.10: DOT Placard Warning\nAugust 2019 Page 6-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls Participant Manual\nEmergency Response Guidebook\nFirst responders use the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) for a transportation\n(e.g., highway or railway) emergency involving hazardous materials. The guide provides\nresponders with information on how to identify the hazards quickly, and details how to\nprotect themselves and the public from issues related to the hazards. Also included in\nthe guide are the recommended evacuation distances for common hazards.\nSights, Sounds, and Smells\nHazardous materials are all around us and may be present regardless of the location or\nwhether there are placards or other posted warnings. While hazardous materials often\nsmell, sound, or look unusual, you may not be able recognize something toxic. Stay\naway from any unidentifiable substance and alert building managers or authorities.\nExercise 6.1: Suppressing Small Fires\nPurpose: This exercise will provide you with experience in two key areas of fire\nsuppression:",

Their\nlabels tell the types of fires for which they are effective and the area that they can\nsuppress.\n• When using portable fire extinguishers, remember P.A.S.S.: Pull, Aim, Squeeze,\nand Sweep. Always test the extinguisher after pulling the pin.\n• When suppressing a fire, always follow the safety rules established for CERTs.\n• There are several methods of placarding hazardous materials being stored or\ntransported, including NFPA, DOT, UN, and NA placards, to help volunteers\nunderstand the types of materials found at a specific location. When faced with\naccidents involving hazardous or unknown materials, volunteers should keep\naway and call for professional help immediately.\nHomework Assignment\nBefore the next session, you

When gathering\nfacts, CERT volunteers need to consider:\n• The time of the event and day of the week.\n― At night, more people will be in their homes, so the greatest need for\nsearch and rescue will be in residential settings. Conversely, during the\nday, people will be at work, so the need will be in commercial buildings.\nThe locations of people in their homes and the amount of daylight\navailable may also affect search and rescue operations.\n• Construction type and terrain.\n― Some types of construction are more susceptible to damage and the type\nof terrain will affect how best to conduct the search.\n• Occupancy.\n― The design purpose of the structure may indicate the likely number of\nsurvivors and their location.\n• Weather.\n― Severe weather will impact survivors and rescuers alike and will hamper\nrescue efforts. Consider forecasts of severe weather as a limiting factor on\nthe period during which search and rescue can occur.\n• Hazards.\n― Knowledge of other potential hazards in the general and immediate areas\nis important to search and rescue efforts. For example, if you suspect a\ngas leak, taking the time to locate and shut off the gas can have a big\nimpact in terms of loss of life.\nExercise 7.1: Gathering Facts\nPurpose: This exercise will give you the opportunity to consider some of the facts that\nCERT search and rescue teams will need to gather during size-up.\nInstructions:\n• Refer to the Scenario handout.\n• Brainstorm the following questions:\n― What does this scenario tell you about the probable density for the\naffected area?\n― What does this scenario tell you about the facts that volunteers must\ngather?\n― What impact could these facts have on search and rescue operations?\n― What kinds of search and rescue operations are probable?\n― What, if any, are the constraints that search and rescue personnel may\nface in this scenario?\nAugust 2019 Page 7-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n― Can volunteers overcome constraints within the established CERT\nmission? If so, how?\nScenario\nAt 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 9, a squall line passed through your town. Because of\nthe difference in barometric pressure on either side of the front, a “gust front” with\nstraight-line winds of more than 70 miles per hour preceded the squall line. Continued\nstrong winds and extremely heavy rain followed the gust front. The town loses\nelectricity.\nYou activate in accordance with your CERT program’s standard operating procedures\n(SOPs). On the way to the staging area at the local high school, you notice considerable\ndamage, including felled trees and utility lines. Many streets are impassable, making\nyou take a roundabout route to the high school. As you make your way to the staging\narea, you see that the roof has blown off of a large portion of a local shopping center\nand that the exterior wall on the west end of the structure has collapsed.\nAfter reaching the staging area, you check in with the Logistics Team Leader, who\nassigns you to Search and Rescue Team 2. Although CERT volunteers cannot venture\ninto the section of the shopping center that has collapsed, Search and Rescue Team 2\nwill be searching near the collapsed area to see if there are survivors in that area.\nStep 2: Assess and Communicate Damage\nThere are general guidelines for assessing damage in interior searches and exterior\nsearches. When in doubt about the condition of a building, CERT volunteers should\nalways use the more cautious assessment. If you are unsure about whether damage to\na building is moderate or heavy, CERT volunteers should assume heavy damage. The\nCERT mission changes depending on the amount of structural damage.\nCERT Mission and Types of Damages\nThe CERT mission for interior searches depends on if damage is light, moderate, or\nheavy.\nDamage is Light\nThe CERT mission is to locate; assess; treat airway, major bleeding, and low body\ntemperature; continue size-up; and document.\nLight damage includes:\n• Superficial damage;\n• Broken windows;\n• Superficial cracks or breaks in the wall surface, for example, fallen or cracked\nplaster; and\n• Minor damage to the interior contents.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-6\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nDamage is Moderate\nThe CERT mission is to locate; treat airway, major bleeding, and low body temperature;\nevacuate; warn others; continue size-up while minimizing the number of rescuers and\ntime spent inside the structure.\nModerate damage includes:\n• Visible signs of damage;\n• Decorative work damaged or fallen;\n• Many visible cracks or breaks in the wall surface;\n• Major damage to interior contents; and\n• Building still on foundation.\nDamage is Heavy\nThe CERT mission is to secure the building perimeter and warn others of the danger in\nentering the building.\nHeavy damage includes:\n• Partial or total collapse;\n• Tilting;\n• Obvious structural instability;\n• Building off foundation;\n• Heavy smoke or fire;\n• Gas leaks/hazardous materials inside; and\n• Rising or moving water.\nCERT volunteers are not to enter a building with heavy damage under any\ncircumstances.\nAssessing Damage\nAssessing the damage of a building or structure will require an examination from all\nsides. Be sure to do an initial \"lap around\" the building.\nIn assessing damage, CERT personnel must consider probable levels of damage based\non the type and age of construction.\nIn addition to a visual assessment, rescuers should also “listen” to damaged structures.\nIf a building is creaking or “groaning,” it is unstable and volunteers should not enter it.\nCommunicating Damage\nYou can describe different locations within and around the structure by using the ABCD\nstandard, with A corresponding to the front of the building and B, C, and D representing\nthe sides of the building moving clockwise from A.\nUsing this system, volunteers can break down the area inside of a structure by\nquadrants to facilitate communication. For instance, a hazard or survivor located closest\nto the A and B sides of the structure is in the A/B quadrant.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-7\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nRemember, you must communicate your findings to the CERT command post or\nresponding agencies.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nTable 7.2: Probable Severity and Type of Earthquake Damage Based on Construction Type\nConstruction\nDescription Probable Damage Areas Severity\nType\n• Wood frame • Masonry chimney Light\n• Utilities\n• Pre-1933 • Foundation Moderate\nSingle-Family movement\nDwelling • Utilities\n• Porches\n• Hillside • Unique hazards Heavy\n• Ground failure\nMulti-Family • Up-and-down and/or side- • Soft first floor Moderate\nDwelling by side living units • Utilities\nUnreinforced • Pre-1933 construction • Walls collapse, Heavy\nBrick • Lime or sand mortar then roof\n• “King Row” or\n• “Soldier Row” (bricks turned\non end every 5-7 rows)\n• Reinforcing plates\n• Arched windows and doors\n• Recessed windows and\ndoors\nTilt-up • Large warehouses and • Roof collapses, Heavy\nplants then walls\n• Concrete slabs lifted into\nplace\n• Walls in set approximately\n6-8 inches\n• Lightweight roof\nconstruction\n• Broken glass Light\n• Content movement\nHigh-Rise • Steel reinforced\n• Exterior trim and\nfascia\nStep 3: Consider Probabilities\nBecause you will be working in close proximity to the dangerous situation, considering\nwhat will probably happen and what could happen are of critical importance. Be sure to\nidentify potentially life-threatening hazards and ask:\n• How stable is the situation?\n― Even within a structure that appears from the outside to have only minimal\nor moderate damage, nonstructural damage or instability inside the\nstructure can pose real danger to the rescue team. CERT volunteers\nshould think about what they already know about the structure that has\nbeen damaged. Are lawn chemicals, paints, or other potentially hazardous\nmaterials stored within the structure? How are they stored? Where are\nAugust 2019 Page 7-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nthey? It will not take CERT volunteers much time to answer these types of\nquestions, but the answers could make a huge difference in how they\napproach the search.\n• What secondary factors should CERT volunteers consider?\n― Take a moment to look around and assess the situation outside of the\nimmediate area. What is the weather doing? Is the wind changing? Is a\nstorm moving in that would affect the response? Is there a crowd growing?\nAre there very few people around? Do you hear first responders in the\ndistance, or is everything quiet?\n• What else could go wrong?\n― Based on the information gathered during Steps 1 and 2 of the size-up,\nCERT volunteers should take a few moments to play “What if?” to try to\nidentify additional risks that they may face. What happens if the power\ngoes out during the search? What if a wall that appears stable shifts and\ncollapses? Applying “Murphy’s Law” to the situation could save CERT\nvolunteers’ lives.\n• What does it all mean for the search and rescue?\n― Based on the probabilities, CERTs should think about what they can do to\nreduce the risks associated with the probabilities that they have identified.\nIs a spotter necessary to look for movement that could indicate a possible\ncollapse and warn the rescue team? Is some remedial action required to\nstabilize nonstructural hazards before beginning the search? CERT\nsearch and rescue teams must remember that their own safety is the\npriority.\nStep 4: Assess Your Situation\nRemember that size-up is a compounding process, with each step building upon the\nprevious steps until the decision is made to either begin the search and rescue\noperation or that the situation is not safe to begin. You need to draw on everything you\nlearned from Steps 1 through 3 to assess your situation to determine:\n• Whether the situation is safe enough to continue;\n• The risks that rescuers will face if they continue; and\n• The available resources volunteers will need to conduct the operation safely.\nAssessing resources, including personnel, tools, and equipment, is extremely important\nto search and rescue operations.\nRescue Resources\nSearch and rescue resources include personnel, equipment, and tools. Below, find\nquestions that you should ask yourself regarding the availability of these types of\nresources.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nTable 7.3: Search and Rescue Resource Planning Questions\nResource Planning Questions\n• How many trained CERT volunteers are available for this\noperation?\n• Who lives and/or works in the area?\n• During what hours are these people most likely to be\navailable?\nPersonnel\n• What skills or hobbies do they have that might be useful in\nsearch and rescue operations?\n• What might be the most effective means of mobilizing their\nefforts?\n• Do all team members have everyone else’s cell number?\n• What equipment is available locally that might be useful for\nsearch and rescue?\n• Where is it located?\nEquipment\n• How can volunteers access it?\n• On which structures (or types of structures) might it be most\neffective?\n• What tools are available that might be useful to lift, move, or\nTools cut disaster debris?\n• What tools are available that will aid communication?\nStep 5: Establish Priorities\nAfter evaluating the situation and keeping in mind that the safety of the CERT volunteer\nis always the top priority, the next step is to determine:\n• What should be done; and\n• In what order.\nThe safety of CERT volunteers is always the first priority and will dictate some of the\nother priorities. For example, volunteers must complete the task of removing or\nmitigating known hazards before teams begin to search. Think through the situation\nlogically to determine how you should approach the operation.\nPriority determinations are based on:\n• The safety of CERT volunteers;\n• Life safety for survivors and others;\n• Protection of the environment; and\n• Protection of property.\nRemember your goal: Rescue the greatest number in the shortest amount of time, but\nnot at the expense of your own safety.\nStep 6: Make Decisions\nAt this point in the size-up you will make decisions about where to deploy your\nresources to do the most good while maintaining an adequate margin of safety. You will\nbase many of your decisions on the priorities established during Step 5.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nStep 7: Develop Plan of Action\nStep 7 is where all of the information you have about the situation comes together.\nDuring Step 7, the CERT Team Leader (TL) will decide specifically how the team will\nconduct its operation, considering the highest priority tasks first.\nYou do not have to write down an action plan, but when search and rescue operations\nare required, the situation is probably complex enough that a written plan of some type\nwill be important.\nA plan should:\n• Help focus the operation on established priorities and decisions.\n• Provide for documentation to give to responding agencies when they arrive on\nscene.\n• Provide for documentation that will become part of the record of the CERT’s\noverall operation.\nKeep notes as you develop your action plan. Volunteers should document any changes\nmade to the initial plan based on new information that emerges.\nStep 8: Take Action\nThis step involves putting the plan developed in Step 7 into action.\nStep 9: Evaluate Progress\nStep 9, Evaluate Progress, is the most critical step, not only in terms of evaluating\nwhether the plan works, but also from a safety standpoint.\nRemember that size-up is ongoing and that information gained during Step 9 needs to\nbe fed back into the decision-making process for possible revision of priorities and\nupdated action planning.\nSpecific Safety Considerations\nRegardless of the severity of structural damage, rescuer safety must be the primary\nconcern. The most frequent causes of rescuer deaths are disorientation and secondary\ncollapse.\nFollow these guidelines during all search and rescue operations:\n• Use a buddy system.\n― Successful search and rescue depend on teamwork.\n• Be alert for hazards (e.g., power lines, natural gas leaks, hazardous materials,\nsharp objects).\n― You should never attempt to search an area where water is rising.\n• Use safety equipment.\n― Wearing gloves and a helmet will protect a rescuer's hands and head.\nKneepads, coveralls, and thick-soled boots will protect a rescuer from\nglass and other sharp objects found on the ground following many natural\ndisasters. The primary cause of rescuer problems after working in a\nAugust 2019 Page 7-12\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nstructural collapse is breathing dust, so a dust mask is essential. However,\na dust mask will not filter out all harmful materials. If volunteers suspect\nthe presence of chemical or biological agents, they must evacuate to an\nupwind location and notify professional responders.\n• Have backup teams available to allow rotation of teams, prevent fatigue, and\nensure help if a team gets into trouble. Have teams drink fluids and eat to keep\nthemselves fresh.\nExercise 7.2: Search and Rescue Size-up\nPurpose: This exercise is an interactive activity that will provide an opportunity to\npractice some of the thinking processes involved in planning and search and rescue\nsize-up.\nThe brainstorming required will help you to begin to assess your neighborhoods or\nworkplaces in terms of building structures, hazardous materials, and any necessary\nsafety precautions.\nInstructions:",

The search operation involves two\nprocesses:\n• Employing search techniques based on the size-up; and\n• Locating survivors.\nBy using these processes, search operations will be more efficient, thorough, and safe.\nThey will also facilitate later rescue operations. Although the processes are related, this\nsection addresses them one at a time. Interior search operations are the most common\nand discussed first; exterior search operations will be discussed later in this unit.\nLocating Potential Survivors in a Structure\nThe first step in locating potential survivors in a structure is to gather more precise\ninformation about damage and to develop priorities and plans by conducting a size-up\nof the interior of the building. The data gathered will provide more information about\npossible areas of entrapment or voids.\nStructural Voids\nThere are several types of structural voids:\n• Pancake void\n• Lean-to void\n• “V” void\nSurvivors may be trapped in a structural void. If you hear any signs of life coming from a\nstructural void, report it to the TL immediately and make appropriate markings to direct\nprofessional rescuers, but do not attempt the rescue yourself. Attempting to rescue a\nperson from a structural void without proper equipment may result in completing the\ncollapse and harming the trapped person.\nIf CERT volunteers see collapsed floors or walls, they should leave the premises\nimmediately.\nIndividual Voids\nIndividual voids are spaces into which the survivor may have crawled for protection.\nExamples of individual voids include bathtubs and the space underneath desks.\nChildren may seek shelter in smaller places like cabinets.\nAfter identifying the possible areas of entrapment, CERT volunteers must:\n• Determine the potential number of survivors; and\n• Identify the most probable areas of entrapment.\nSome information may be known through assessment, but CERT volunteers may need\nto get some information by talking to bystanders or those who are familiar with the\nstructure.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nCERT volunteers should ask questions when talking with these individuals, including:\n• How many people live (or work) in the building?\n• Where would they be at this time?\n• What is the building layout?\n• What have you seen or heard?\n• Has anyone come out?\n• What are the normal exit routes from the building?\nBe aware that the event may confuse bystanders. They may tend to exaggerate\npotential numbers or may not even remember the event accurately. Gather as much\ninformation as you can, though, because it will be useful for planning search priorities\nand implementing the search.\nSearch Methodology\nAn effective search methodology:\n• Indicates rescuer location;\n• Locates survivors as quickly and safely as possible; and\n• Prevents duplication of effort.\nSearch Markings\nExperienced search and rescue personnel use the following system. CERTs will use the\nsame system. This will save time for fellow CERT volunteers and other responders\nduring the search and continual size-up of the structure.\nUpon entering a search area, you will make a mark next to the door to indicate that you\nare entering. Do not make the mark on the door or on the wall where the door swings.\nMake a single slash and write the agency or group ID at the “9 o’clock” position. Then\nwrite the date and “time in” at the “12 o’clock” position.\nUpon exiting the search area, make another slash to form an “X” (the agency or group\nID will be in the left quadrant). Enter the search “time out” In the top quadrant.\n• Right quadrant: Enter the areas of the structure searched and any specific\ninformation about hazards.\n• Lower quadrant: Enter information about the survivors found in the search area.\n“L” represents living and “D” represents dead. The search marking on the front of\na structure or building should contain the total number of survivors, whereas\nsearch markings inside the structure or building will include survivor totals for\nspecific search areas. Indicate where survivors were taken.\nSearch Methodology\n• Use the buddy system.\n― Always remain within arm’s reach of at least one other CERT volunteer\nwhen conducting an interior search. This is to enable assistance in the\nevent of a slip or a fall and to be able to push or pull one another out of\nharm's way.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n• Upon entering each space or room, call out to survivors.\n― Shout something like, \"If anyone can hear my voice, come here.\" If any\nsurvivors come to you, ask them for any information that they may have\nabout the building or others who may be trapped then, depending on the\ncondition of the building, give them further directions such as, \"Stay here\"\nor \"Wait outside\".\nRemember that even those who are able to get to you may be in shock and confused.\nWhen giving directions to survivors, CERT volunteers should look directly at the\nsurvivors, speak in short sentences, and keep their directions simple.\nUse a systematic search pattern. Ensure that all areas of the building are covered.\nExamples of systematic search patterns to use include:\n• Bottom-up/top-down; and\n• Right wall/left wall.\nKeep in mind that every interior space has six sides — including the floor and ceiling.\nRescuers must check all six sides to locate hazards such as fixtures that may be\nhanging from the ceiling\n• Stop frequently to listen: Listen for tapping, movement, or voices.\n• Triangulate: Consider using triangulation when a potential survivor’s location is\nobscured. If access permits, three rescuers, guided by survivor sounds, form a\ntriangle around the area and direct flashlights into the area. The light shining from\ndifferent directions will eliminate shadows that could otherwise hide survivors.\nTriangulation should not be used as an initial search method.\n• Report results: Keep complete records both of removed survivors and of\nsurvivors who remain trapped or are dead. Report this information to emergency\nservices personnel when they reach the scene.\nExterior Search\nIn addition to searching inside a structure, CERT volunteers may need to search open\nareas outside of buildings.\nConducting an effective search in open areas requires that searchers work methodically\nand follow standard procedures established by those in charge of the search operation.\nThis is true in all cases, especially if the area is a crime scene, where all potential\nevidence must be protected.\nIf searchers are needed, they should assemble in a central staging area and sign in.\nAuthorities will brief the searchers on what they will be looking for, what areas they are\nresponsible for searching, the pattern of the search, and what they should do if they\ndiscover the missing person, evidence, or related information.\nExterior search patterns include grid, line, quadrant or zone, and spiral. Typically, a grid\npattern is used in large open areas or small areas when a hands-and-knees search is\nconducted.\nGrid is one of the most commonly used types of search patterns. Keep the guidelines\nbelow in mind when conducting a grid search.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n• View the search area as a grid, with searchers initially positioned at one side of\nthe grid.\n• The distance between the searchers should be set according to visibility and\ndebris. In all cases, searchers must remain within line of sight and voice contact\nwith searchers on either side of them.\n• It is critical that the area assigned to each searcher overlaps that of the\nsearchers on either side of them.\n• The searchers proceed, maintaining as straight a line as possible across the\nentire search area. As each searcher moves across the area, they conduct a\nthorough search for survivors within their designated row of the grid.\n• To ensure full coverage, CERTs must record each area searched.\n• A grid search might be particularly useful following a tornado or hurricane.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nSECTION 4: CONDUCTING RESCUE OPERATIONS\nRescues involve three primary functions:",

Therefore, there are certain precautions that\nrescuers must take to minimize risk.\nPrecautions to Minimize Risk\nThere are certain precautions that rescuers must take to minimize risk and increase\ntheir chances of achieving their rescue goals.\n• Know Your Limitations: Many volunteers have been injured or killed during\nrescue operations because they did not pay attention to their own physical and\nmental limitations. CERT rescuers should take the time to drink fluids, eat, relax,\nand rest so that they can return with a clear mind and improved energy.\n• Follow Safety Procedures: CERT volunteers should always use the proper\nsafety equipment required for the situation and follow established procedures,\nincluding:\n― Work in pairs.\n― Assess and treat only in lightly damaged buildings.\n― In moderately damaged buildings, assess only and remove survivors as\nquickly as possible.\n― Never enter an unstable structure.\n― Lift by bending the knees, keeping the back straight, and pushing up with\nthe legs.\n― Carry the load close to the body.\n― Lift and carry no more than is reasonable.\n• Remove Debris: Remove debris as needed to minimize risk to rescuers and to\nfree entrapped survivors.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.1: Proper Body Position for Lifting\nProper body position for lifting showing the back straight and lifting with the knees.\nLeveraging and Cribbing\nYou may encounter situations in which moving debris is needed to free survivors. In\nthese situations, CERT rescuers should consider leveraging and cribbing to move and\nstabilize the debris until the rescue is complete.\n• Leveraging is accomplished by wedging a lever under the object that needs to be\nmoved, with a stationary object underneath it to act as a fulcrum. When the lever\nis forced down over the fulcrum, the far end of the lever will lift the object.\n• A crib is a wooden framework used for support or strengthening the object.\n― Box cribbing means arranging pairs of wood pieces alternately to form a\nstable rectangle.\n― You may use a variety of cribbing materials for these procedures and you\nwill need to improvise by using materials such as tires or structural debris.\nWhatever you use, do not put form over function.\nVolunteers may use leveraging and cribbing together by alternately lifting the object and\nplacing cribbing materials underneath the lifted edge to stabilize it.\nSafety is number one: \"Lift an inch; crib an inch.\" Leveraging and cribbing should be\ngradual for stability, safety, and efficiency.\nIt may also be necessary to use leveraging and cribbing at more than one location (e.g.,\nfront and back) to ensure stability. Never leverage and crib on opposite ends at the\nsame time because doing so will increase the instability of the debris. If leveraging is\nrequired at both ends, lift and crib at one end, then repeat the process at the other end.\nPositioning the lever and the fulcrum correctly is critical for safe operations. The fulcrum\nand pry tool must be perpendicular (90 degrees) to the edge of the object being lifted.\nAttempting to leverage a heavy object using too sharp an angle is inefficient and can\nresult in back injury.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-19\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nBox cribbing is stable, but it requires pieces of cribbing material of relatively uniform\nsize. When such material is not available, “unboxed” cribbing can also work effectively\nto support and stabilize the heavy object.\nWhen you are able to achieve sufficient lift, you should remove the survivor and reverse\nthe leveraging and cribbing procedure to lower the object. You should never leave an\nunsafe condition unless the event has left the structure or building obviously\ncompromised.\nWhen you must remove debris to locate survivors, you should set up a human chain\nand pass the debris from one person to the next. Be careful, however, to set up the\nchain in a position that will not interfere with rescue operations.\nWear your PPE to protect yourself always. Kneepads can be an important addition to\nyour PPE during rescue operations.\nLeveraging and Cribbing Steps\nStep 1: Conduct a size-up of the scene. Gather facts, identify hazards, and establish\npriorities.\nStep 2: Have one person in charge and formulate a plan of action, based upon the\ninformation you have received, to identify how and where to lift and crib and to\ndetermine how you will remove the survivor from underneath the debris.\nStep 3: Gather necessary materials for lifting/cribbing operations: lever, fulcrum,\ncribbing blocks, spacers/wedges. During an actual emergency, you may have to use\ncreative, substitute materials.\nStep 4: Use cribbing materials to stabilize the object prior to lifting.\nStep 5: Distribute cribbing materials as necessary to be readily accessible during the\nlifting operation.\nStep 6: Prepare to lift the object: Assemble the lever and fulcrum at the previously\nidentified location.\nStep 7: Assign a person to monitor and be ready to remove the survivor as soon as\npossible.\nStep 8: Initiate the lift, using the lever and fulcrum for mechanical advantage.\nStep 9: As the object is lifted, add cribbing as needed, one layer at a time.\nStep 10: Once the object is adequately supported, remove the lever and fulcrum. You\nmay then remove the survivor.\nStep 11: Unless the event has left the structure obviously compromised, requiring you\nto evacuate immediately, reinitiate the lift and begin removing cribbing materials,\nreversing the process by which you built the crib.\nStep 12: Progressively lower the object to the ground. Always return the heavy object to\na stable position unless you have to evacuate immediately.\nStep 13: Before you leave, remember to collect the lifting/cribbing supplies to be\navailable for additional operations.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-20\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.2: Leveraging and Cribbing\nTeam Organization for Leveraging/Cribbing Operations\nTeam organization for leveraging/cribbing operation, showing the survivor underneath a\ncollapsed wall and the CERT volunteers at the following locations:\n• Group Leader: In front of collapse, positioned so that he or she can view the\nentire operation while remaining out of the rescuers’ way;\n• Lever Person: At the front edge of the collapsed wall and positioned so that he\nor she can position a fulcrum and lever under the wall;\n• Crib Persons: On either side of the collapsed wall and positioned to enable the\nplacement of cribbing as the wall is raised with the lever; and\n• Medical Care/Survivor Removal Person: Next to the Crib Person who is\nclosest to the survivor’s head.\nImage 7.3: Box Cribbing\nAugust 2019 Page 7-21\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nSteps for building box cribbing:\nStep 1: Position two pieces of wood parallel to each other on either side of the collapse.\nStep 2: Place two pieces of wood perpendicularly across the base pieces.\nSteps 3 and 4: Add additional layers of wood, with each perpendicular to the previous\nlevel.\nRemoving Survivors\nThe basic types of survivor removal are:\n• Self-removal or assist; and\n• Lifts and drags.\nIt is usually best to allow an ambulatory survivor to extricate him or herself. Be aware\nthat ambulatory survivors are not always as strong and free of injury as they believe.\nWhen survivors are freed, they may need assistance to exit the structure.\nExtrication Method\nThe type of extrication method selected should depend on the:\n• General stability of the immediate environment;\n• Number of rescuers available;\n• Strength and ability of the rescuers; and\n• Condition of the survivor.\nIf safety and time permit, you should not use lifts and drags to remove survivors when\nyou suspect the survivors have closed-head or spinal injuries. In such cases, stabilize\nthe spine using a backboard. You can use doors, tables, and similar materials as\nimprovised backboards. The backboard must be able to carry the person and remember\nto use proper lifting techniques.\nWhen moving survivors, rescuers must use teamwork and communication and try to\nkeep the survivor's spine in a straight line. Remember, rescuer safety and the condition\nof the building will dictate the approach.\nOne-Person Arm Carry\nIf a rescuer is physically able and the survivor is small, the rescuer may use the one-\nperson arm carry to lift and carry the survivor by:\n• Reaching around the survivor’s back and under the knees; and\n• Lifting the survivor while keeping your back straight and lifting with your legs.\nConsider the size of the survivor and the distance in which you will need to carry\nhim or her before using this carry.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-22\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.4: One-Person Arm Carry\nOne-Person Arm Carry with rescuer holding survivor around the back and under the knees.\nPack-Strap Carry\nAnother way for a single rescuer to lift a survivor safely is by using the one-person pack-\nstrap carry. Using this method, you should:\nStep 1: Stand with your back to the survivor.\nStep 2: Place the survivor's arms over your shoulders and grab the hands in front of\nyour chest.\nStep 3: Hoist the survivor by bending forward slightly, until the survivor’s feet just clear\nthe floor.\n*Note: The pack-strap carry is most effective for quick removal of a survivor over a\nshort distance.\nImage 7.5: Pack-Strap Carry\nOne-Person Pack-Strap Carry in which the rescuer places the survivor’s arms over his or her\nshoulders and grabs the survivor’s wrists over his or her chest, then hoists the survivor by\nbending over slightly.\nTwo-Person Carry\nSurvivor removal is easier when multiple rescuers are available. The survivor’s upper\nbody will weigh more than his or her lower body; therefore, position rescuers with\ngreater body strength at the survivor’s upper body. Two rescuers working together can\nremove a survivor using a two-person carry.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-23\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nRescuer 1: Squat at the survivor’s head and grasp the survivor from behind around the\nmidsection. Reach under the arms and grasp the survivor's left wrist with rescuer’s right\nhand, and vice versa. Crossing the wrists creates a more secure hold on the survivor,\npulling their arms and elbows closer to their body. This will be helpful if rescuers need to\ncarry the survivor through any narrow passages.\nRescuer 2: Squat between the survivor's knees, facing either toward or away from the\nsurvivor. Note that, if the rescuers will carry the survivor over uneven areas such as\nstairs, the rescuers will need to face each other. Grasp the outside of the survivor's legs\nat the knees.\nBoth rescuers: Rise to a standing position simultaneously, keeping backs straight and\nlifting with the legs. Walk the survivor to safety.\nImage 7.6: Two-Person Carry\nTwo-person Carry in which Rescuer 1 squats at the survivor’s head and grasps the survivor from\nbehind at the midsection. Rescuer 1 should use his right hand to grab the survivor’s right wrist,\nand vice versa. Rescuer 2 squats between the survivor’s knees, grasping the outside of the knees.\nBoth rescuers rise to the standing position. *\nChair Carry\nTwo rescuers can also remove a survivor by seating him or her on a chair:\nRescuer 1: Cross the survivor’s arms in his or her lap. Facing the back of the chair,\ngrasp the back upright.\nRescuer 2: Grasp the two front legs of the chair.\nBoth rescuers: Tilt the chair back, lift simultaneously, and walk out.\nIt is best to use a sturdy, non-swivel chair for this lift.\n*Note: If rescuers will need to carry the survivor over uneven surfaces, such as stairs,\nthe rescuers must face each other.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-24\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nImage 7.7: Chair Carry\nChair Carry in which the survivor is placed in a sturdy, non-swivel chair and tilted backwards as\nrescuers lift the survivor. This lift requires two rescuers. If possible, secure the survivor to the\nchair. *\nBlanket Carry\nUse the blanket carry for survivors you cannot remove by other means. The blanket\ncarry requires four to six rescuers to ensure stability for the survivor and one rescuer\ndesignated the lead person:\nStep 1: Position a blanket next to the survivor, ensuring that the blanket will extend\nunder the survivor’s head.\nStep 2: Tuck the blanket under the survivor and assist the survivor in moving to the\ncenter of the blanket. If necessary, use the log rolling technique to position them on the\nblanket.\nStep 3: With three rescuers squatting on each side, roll up the edges of the blanket\nagainst the survivor to grasp a “handle.\" The lead person checks the team for even\nweight distribution and correct lifting position.\nStep 4: The lead person calls out, \"Ready to lift on the count of three: One, two, three,\nlift.\"\nStep 5: The team lifts and stands in unison—keeping the survivor level—and carries the\nsurvivor feet first.\n*Note: that if rescuers will need to carry the survivor over uneven surfaces, such as\nstairs, the rescuers must face each other.\nThe team must also lower the survivor together, using the following steps:\nStep 1: The lead person calls out, \"Ready to lower on the count of three: One, two,\nthree, lower.\"\nStep 2: The team lowers the survivor in unison, exercising caution to keep the survivor\nlevel.\nYou can use a variety of materials — such as blankets, carpets, and folded tables — as\nimprovised stretchers.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-25\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\nLog Rolling\nRescuers should use the “log rolling” technique to move survivors with a suspected or\nconfirmed cervical spine injury. If the survivor is unconscious, assume he or she has a\ncervical spine injury. The rescuer at a survivor’s head should give commands as fellow\nrescuers roll the survivor as a single unit onto the blanket, backboard, or other support.\nDrag/Blanket Drag\nWhen a rescuer is not able to carry a survivor, they can drag the survivor by grasping\neither the feet or the shoulders and dragging him or her clear of the hazard. If a blanket\nis available, use the blanket drag by following these steps:\nStep 1: Wrap the survivor in a blanket.\nStep 2: Squat down and grasp an edge of the blanket. Step 3: Drag the survivor across\nthe floor.\nImage 7.8: Correct Drag Technique\nCorrect drag technique, showing the rescuer grasping the survivor by either the feet or shoulders\nand dragging him or her clear of the hazard.\nImage 7.9 - Blanket Drag\nBlanket drag, showing the survivor wrapped in a blanket with the rescuer squatting at the\nsurvivor’s head.

Your mission\nwhen dealing with heavily damaged structures or situations that are clearly\nunsafe (e.g., rising or swiftly moving water) is to warn others.\n• Search and rescue size-up follows the same process as other CERT size-up\noperations. Size-up continues throughout search and rescue efforts and provides\ninformation about how to proceed. Remember: the CERT mission is to ensure\nsafety and organization during the evaluation. Therefore, if the size-up indicates\nthat evacuation of the team is necessary, do so immediately.\n• When the decision to begin search operations is made, CERT searchers must:\n― Remember that the first priority is volunteer safety;\n― Employ appropriate search techniques; and\n― Locate any survivors and check for life threatening injuries.\n• Locating survivors means completing a size-up of the building interior to identify\nareas of entrapment, then conducting a search that:\n― Is systematic and thorough;\n― Avoids unnecessary duplication of effort; and\n― Documents results.\n• Rescue involves these main functions:\n― Moving objects and debris to create a safe rescue environment and free\nsurvivors;\n― Assessing or stabilizing survivors by checking for life-threatening\nconditions (airway obstruction, severe bleeding, and low body\ntemperature); and\n― Removing survivors as safely and as quickly as possible based on the\nsize-up.\n• Remember that rescuer safety is always the top priority.\n• Rescue operations hinge on maintaining rescuer safety, which requires CERT\nvolunteers to recognize their own limitations. CERT volunteers should never\nattempt anything that exceeds their limitations at that point in time.\n• Rescuers may leverage and crib to lift heavy debris and give access to trapped\nsurvivors.\n• Rescuers can remove survivors in several ways, depending on:\n― Their condition;\nAugust 2019 Page 7-28\n\n\nCERT Unit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations Participant Manual\n― The number of rescuers available;\n― The strength and ability of the rescuers; and\n― The stability of the environment.\n• Stabilize survivors with suspected head or spinal injuries on some type of\nbackboard before removing. When possible, defer these removals to trained\nEMS personnel.\nHomework Assignment\nRead and become familiar with the unit covered in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page 7-29\n\n\nCERT Unit

      "content": "2. List the eight signs of terrorism and describe how to report suspicious activity;\n3. Explain the role of a CERT volunteer during a terrorist incident; and\n4. Describe activities to prepare for a terrorist incident at home, at work, and in the\ncommunity.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-1\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 2: TERRORIST GOALS AND TACTICS\nThe U.S. Department of Justice’s definition of terrorism:\n“The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to\nintimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment\nthereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”\nTerrorism may be perpetrated by foreign or domestic individuals or groups and\nalthough the results are similar, these groups may select different targets and\nuse different tactics to achieve their goals.\nTerrorist Goals\nTerrorists use violence to influence government policy and to achieve specific objectives\nfor their cause. Attacks are intended to undermine the public’s sense of safety and their\nconfidence in the government. Attackers seek to portray the government as ineffective,\nweak, and/or otherwise incapable.\nTerrorist attacks are often perpetrated by ideological extremists who are prepared to die\nin what they consider a symbolic sacrifice or act of martyrdom. Attackers frequently\nexploit social media seeking to spread misinformation and broadcast their actions to\naudiences around the globe, with the desire of increasing fear while simultaneously\nbolstering their credibility and legitimacy with like-minded supporters.\nNew Tactics\nRecently, terrorist attacks have trended away from large resource intensive plots such\nas the September 11 attacks to more decentralized, less sophisticated attacks like\nthose in Paris, France in 2016. Attackers have favored smaller, less centrally controlled\nnetworks, using more simplistic and accessible means such as guns and homemade\nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs). These components are easier to acquire, control,\nand conceal than large high-yield explosives, biological, radiological, or nuclear devices.\nAlthough there is always some risk from CBRNE type incidents and the United States\nremains vigilant against these threats, it is difficult to obtain and deploy these types of\nweapons.\nActive Shooter\nAn Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people\nin a confined and populated area. In most cases, active shooters use firearms(s) and\nthere is no pattern or method to their selection of targets. Active shooter situations are\nunpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law\nenforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate harm to survivors.\nMany recent terrorist attacks have included armed individuals with some training\nindiscriminately shooting civilians; although the motivations are different than a single\nactive shooter, the results are similar: rapidly accumulating casualties in a contained\nspace.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-2\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nImprovised Explosive Devices\nAn IED attack is the use of a “homemade” bomb and/or destructive device to destroy,\nincapacitate, harass, or distract. Because they are improvised, IEDs can come in many\nforms, ranging from a small pipe bomb to a sophisticated device capable of causing\nmassive damage and loss of life.\nTerrorist networks both domestic and abroad have published numerous sets of\ninstructions on how to make homemade explosives. IEDs consist of a variety of\ncomponents that include an initiator, switch, main charge, power source, and a\ncontainer. IEDs can be worn (belts, vests), carried (bags, backpacks, containers of all\nsizes/types), or transported in a vehicle; placed or thrown by a person; delivered in a\npackage; or concealed on the roadside.\nTo gain a better understanding of the impact that IEDs can have, the table below\nillustrates the damage radius cause by various sizes and types of IEDs.\nImage 8.1: IED Impact\nIEDs may be surrounded by or packed with additional materials or “enhancements”\nsuch as nails, glass, or metal fragments designed to increase the amount of shrapnel\npropelled by the explosion to maximize casualties. Enhancements may also include\nother elements such as hazardous materials. An IED can be initiated by a variety of\nmethods depending on the intended target.\nComplex Coordinated Terrorist Attacks\nA complex coordinated terrorist attack is a synchronized attack, conducted by two or\nmore semi-independent teams at multiple locations in close succession, initiated with\nlittle or no warning, using well trained attackers and employing one or more of the\nfollowing: fire arms, explosives, and fire as a weapon.\nAs seen in Paris, France in 2016, attackers have coordinated their actions to hit multiple\ntargets nearly simultaneously. When conducting these attacks, there may be pre-\nplanned coordination as well as real-time coordination between attackers. These\nattacks can be extremely lethal in a relatively short period of time.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-3\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nCyber Attacks\nAnother type of terrorist weapon is deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer\nnetworks. This is known as cyberterrorism. To help guard against cyberterrorism, it is\nimportant that computer users implement appropriate security measures.\nCybersecurity involves protecting infrastructure by preventing, detecting, and\nresponding to cyber incidents. Unlike physical threats that prompt immediate action—\nlike stop, drop, and roll in the event of a fire—cyber threats are often difficult to identify\nand comprehend. Among these dangers are viruses erasing entire systems, intruders\nbreaking into systems and altering files, intruders using your computer or device to\nattack others, or intruders stealing confidential information. The spectrum of cyber risks\nis limitless. Threats, some more serious and sophisticated than others, can have wide-\nranging effects at the individual, community, organizational, and national levels.\n• Organized cybercrime, state-sponsored hackers, and cyber espionage can pose\nnational security risks to our country.\n• Transportation, power, and other services may be disrupted by large-scale cyber\nincidents. The extent of the disruption will be determined by many factors such\nas the target and size of the incident.\n• Vulnerability to data breach and loss increases if an organization’s network is\ncompromised. Information about a company, its employees, and its customers\ncan be at risk.\n• Individually-owned devices such as computers, tablets, mobile phones, and\ngaming systems that connect to the Internet are vulnerable to intrusion. Personal\ninformation may be at risk without proper security.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-4\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 3: PREPARING YOUR COMMUNITY\nIf You See Something, Say Something: Potential Indicators\nWe all have a responsibility to play an active role in keeping the country safe. The\nphrase, “If you see something, say something,” took on additional power after the foiled\nTimes Square bomb plot in New York City. On May 1, 2010, street vendors in Times\nSquare noticed a smoking SUV with its blinkers on, engine running, and no one inside.\nThey decided to say something to a police officer. Thousands of people cleared from\nthe area while the bomb was dismantled.\nEight Signs of Terrorism\nThe presence of even a few signs may indicate the possibility of a terrorist attack. It is\nimportant to understand what these signs may look like as they are executed so you are\nable to identify them within your community. If you recognize one of these signs being\nacted out, it is important to contact your local law enforcement and effectively\ncommunicate the suspicious activity that you have identified. The FBI’s Suspicious\nActivity Reporting (SAR) tip line (https://tips.fbi.gov/) is an avenue for reporting any\nsuspicious activities.\nSigns exhibited by potential terrorists (often in this order) include:\n• Surveillance: The targeted area is being watched and studied carefully. This\nmay include recording or monitoring activities.\n• Elicitation: Information is gathered that is specific to the intended target. This\nmay be by mail, phone, or in person.\n• Tests of Security: Local security measures are tested and analyzed, including\nmeasuring reaction times to security breaches or attempts to penetrate security.\n• Funding: Raising, transferring, and spending money, which may include selling\ndrugs or stolen merchandise, human trafficking, and funneling money through\nbusinesses or charities.\n• Acquiring Supplies: Necessary supplies are gathered to prepare the attack,\nincluding weapons/weapon components, transportation, and communications.\nSupplies may be purchased with cash only.\n• Impersonation or Suspicious People Who Do Not Belong: People\nimpersonating roles to gain access or information and people who don’t fit in or\ndon’t seem to belong in the location.\n• Rehearsal and Dry Runs: Groups or individuals will often map out routes,\ndetermine traffic flow and timing ahead of time, and can also operate test runs\nbefore the actual attack.\n• Deployment: The final and most urgent phase when terrorists are deploying\nassets and getting into position. Attack is imminent.\nAlthough it is not the mission of CERT volunteers to keep constant watch for these\nsigns, everyone should be alert to changes in their environment as a clue to a possible\nterrorist attack and report suspicious activities to appropriate authorities.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-5\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nPotential Targets in Your Community\nWhile hardened targets, such as government buildings, military installations, and\ninfrastructure (e.g., power grids and dams) remain viable targets for certain groups,\nattacks have trended towards easier, less secure targets. Terrorists have frequently\nselected soft targets like schools, parks, large gathering spaces, cafés, and concert\nhalls. Although differently motivated, active shooters in the United States have also\nselected less secure targets like malls, movie theatres, and universities. Smaller, less\ninvolved plots still generate high casualties and allow the attackers to achieve their\nobjectives with fewer resources.\nPreparedness\nTerrorist attacks frequently occur without warning; however, being alert, reporting\nsuspicious activities, and taking general preparedness steps, such as having a plan to\ncommunicate with loved ones, will help you if one does occur. If you believe a terrorist\nattack is imminent, call 9-1-1 and follow the instructions provided.\nExercise 8.1: Preparing for a Terrorism-Related Event\nPurpose: As with all types of disasters and emergencies, preparation is key to planning\nfor a terrorism-related event. Although it is often difficult to predict when such an event\nmay occur, there are several steps that you can take today to be prepared.\nInstructions:",

      "content": "If you are unable to run, evacuate or hide and when your life is in imminent danger,\nyou may attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter by:\n• Taking decisive action;\n• Acting as aggressively as possible against him/her;\n• Throwing items and improvising weapons;\n• Yelling; and\n• Committing to your actions.\nHow to Respond When Law Enforcement Arrives\nLaw enforcement’s purpose is to stop the active shooter as soon as possible. Officers\nwill proceed directly to the shooting without stopping to render aid to the survivors.\n• Officers may arrive in teams;\n• Officers may wear street clothes, regular patrol uniforms, or external bulletproof\nvests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment;\n• Officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, and/or handguns; and\n• Officers may shout commands and may push individuals to the ground for their\nsafety.\nHow to react when law enforcement arrives:\n• Try to remain calm;\n• Follow officers’ instructions;\n• Put down any items in your hands (e.g., bags, jackets);\n• Immediately raise hands and spread fingers;\n• Keep hands visible at all times;\n• Avoid making quick movements toward officers such as holding on to them;\n• Avoid pointing, screaming, and/or yelling; and\n• Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating, just proceed in\nthe direction from which officers are entering the premises.\nInformation to provide to law enforcement or 9-1-1 operator:\n• Location of the active shooter(s);\n• Number of shooters, if more than one;\n• Physical description of shooter(s);\n• Number and type of weapons held by the shooter(s); and\n• Number of potential targets at the location.\nThe first officers to arrive to the scene will not stop to help injured persons. Expect\nrescue teams comprised of additional officers and emergency medical personnel to\nfollow the initial officers. These rescue teams will treat and remove any injured persons.\nThey may also call upon able-bodied individuals to assist in removing the wounded from\nthe premises.\nOnce you have reached a safe location or an assembly point, you will likely be held in\nthat area by law enforcement until the situation is under control, and all witnesses have\nAugust 2019 Page 8-8\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nbeen identified and questioned. Do not leave until law enforcement authorities have\ninstructed you to do so.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-9\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nSECTION 5: UNTIL HELP ARRIVES\nCERT volunteers are NOT equipped or trained to respond to terrorist incidents. CERT\nvolunteers should in no way activate or respond to an incident in their community.\nHowever, while highly unlikely, it is possible that you may find yourself in a situation that\nyou believe to be a terrorist attack. In this rare circumstance, CERT volunteers have a\ndeveloped skillset to provide care until help arrives.\nLike in any other situation, volunteers should follow the direction of law enforcement and\nfirst responders. You should be mindful of your limits and recognize that your safety is\nyour top priority. Stay safe. Do not put yourself at risk but save lives if you can.\nIf you are willing and able to assist, remember the most important life-saving\ninterventions, recognize what the stress of the situation can do to you, and understand\nthe physical impact of being in a potential terrorist situation.\nTreating Others\nIf you believe you are able to help those around you, focus on the lifesaving\ninterventions that were covered in Unit 3.\n• Stop Bleeding: The average person has approximately five liters of blood.\nSevere blood loss can result in irreversible shock. This means that if you lose\nabout half of your body’s blood supply, no matter what anyone does to try to save\nyou, death is unavoidable. You must get bleeding under control as soon as\npossible. The first way to control severe bleeding is through applying direct\npressure. For more information on controlling bleeding, please refer to page 3-4\nof the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Maintain Body Temperature: It is important to maintain the patient’s body\ntemperature. If necessary, place a blanket or other material under and/or over\nthe patient to provide protection from extreme ground temperatures (hot or cold).\nPeople with very serious injuries are more susceptible to hypothermia, which can\nincrease the risk of death. For more information on maintaining body\ntemperature, please refer to page 3-5 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Opening the Airway: Positioning an injured patient to keep their airway open\nand clear is critical to saving their life. The best position for the body is one in\nwhich the chest can expand fully and the airway is not at risk of being obstructed.\nIn other words, the best position is one in which the tongue cannot flop back into\nthe individual’s throat and one in which blood or fluid does not end up in the\nlungs (aspirated), particularly in the case with someone with facial trauma. There\nare different ways to position an injured patient to keep their airway open\ndepending on if the patient is conscious or unconscious. For more information on\nopening the airway, please refer to page 3-7 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\n• Providing Comfort: CERT volunteers can be of great value to injured and\nemotional patient simply by offering comfort and support. No special skills are\nneeded—just a calm and reassuring presence. For more information on providing\ncomfort, please refer to page 3-9 of the Unit 3 Participant Manual.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-10\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nYou must make the best decisions possible with the information that you have at hand.\nEven if an incident turns out not to be terrorist related, you have made the right decision\nif you have done the most good for the greatest number and have not been injured.\nRecognizing Stress\nBefore you step forward to help it is important to recognize how the stress of the\nsituation may affect you. In any life-threatening situation, you will feel fear and this fear\nwill impact your mind and body. It is important for you to be aware of what may happen,\nso you can recognize these responses as a normal part of your body’s response to\nstress. It is normal to experience certain physical and psychological changes.\nRecognize that:\n• Fear is typically at its peak once we comprehend the danger of the situation;\n• Fear has profound effects on the mind and body; and\n• Fear can influence action.\nPhysical Impact\nExplosions create a high-pressure blast that sends debris flying and lifts people off the\nground. The type of injuries and the number of people hurt will vary depending on: the\nphysical environment and the size of the blast, the amount of shielding between people\nand the blast, fires or structural damage that result from the explosion, and whether the\nexplosion occurs in a closed space or an open area. Injuries common to explosions\ninclude:\n• Overpressure damage to the lungs, ears, abdomen, and other pressure sensitive\norgans. Blast lung injury, a condition caused by the extreme pressure of an\nexplosion, is the leading cause of illness and death for initial survivors of an\nexplosion.\n• Fragmentation injuries caused by projectiles thrown by the blast—material from\nthe bomb, shrapnel, or flying debris that penetrates the body and causes\ndamage.\n• Impact injuries are caused when the blast throws a person into another object\ncausing serious injuries, including fractures, amputation, and trauma to the head\nand neck.\n• Thermal injuries caused by burns to the skin, mouth, sinuses, and lungs.\n• Other injuries including exposure to toxic substances, crush injuries, and\naggravation of pre-existing conditions (e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure).\nRemember life-saving interventions for controlling bleeding, maintaining body\ntemperature, and opening airways that were taught in Unit 3: Disaster Medical\nOperations Part 1.\nSecondary Attacks\nTerrorist attacks, especially those involving explosives, may include a secondary wave\ntargeting those who are providing care to the injured. Be highly aware of your\nsurroundings and move away from danger as soon as you are able. If you can do so,\ntake others with you.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-11\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nA bomb explosion can cause secondary explosions if gasoline, natural gas, or other\nflammable material is ignited. Secondary hazards that result can include fire with\npossibly toxic smoke, disruption of electric power, ruptured natural gas lines and water\nmains, and debris. There can be loss of traffic control in the blast area with possible\ntraffic accidents involving fleeing citizens.\nWhat Professional Responders Will Do\nThere are several measures that you can expect professional responders to take when\nthey arrive at the scene of a terrorist incident.\nSize-up\nThe first step that professional responders will take when they arrive at the scene is to\nconduct a thorough size-up. They will follow steps that are very similar to those that\nCERTs take to determine:\n• What is going on;\n• How bad the situation is and how much worse it could get;\n• What measures can be taken to control the incident safely; and\n• What resources will be needed.\nEstablish Zones\nCERTs can expect professional responders to treat some terrorist incidents the same\nas hazardous materials incidents. As such, the next step that they will take is to\nestablish three incident zones.",

However, there are some basic guidelines that can be noted for\nthese types of incidents.\nBasic HAZMAT Decontamination Procedures\nThe objective of decontamination is to remove harmful chemicals or particles of\nradioactive dirt or dust that have come in contact with the skin or clothes.\n• Leave the contaminated area immediately. Depending on the circumstances, go\ninside, go outside, or go upwind, uphill, or upstream from the contaminant. (Seek\na distance of at least 1,000 to 1,500 feet.)\n• Take decontamination action. Seconds count! The goal is to limit the time that\nthe agent is in contact with the skin.\n― Remove everything from the body, including jewelry. Cut off clothing that\nwould normally be removed over the head to reduce the probability of\ninhaling or ingesting the agent. Seal your clothes in a plastic bag.\n― Wash hands before using them to shower. If no shower is available,\nimprovise with water from faucets or bottled water.\n― Flush the entire body, including the eyes, underarms, and groin area, with\ncopious amounts of cool water. Hot water opens the pores of the skin and\ncan promote absorption of the contaminant. Using copious amounts of\nwater is important because some chemicals react to small amounts of\nwater.\nIf soap is immediately available, mix the soap with water for decontamination. Avoid\nscrubbing with soap because scrubbing can rub the chemical into the skin rather than\nremove it.\nWash hair with soap or shampoo or rinse with water if soap is not available. Do not use\nconditioner as that can bind radioactive materials to your hair and make it difficult to\nremove.\nIf hosing someone else off or pouring water from a container, avoid both physical\ncontact with the person and with the runoff.\nThe water used for decontamination must be contained and covered or drained outside\nof the shelter area to avoid shelter contamination.\nBlot dry using an absorbent cloth. Do not rub the skin! Put on clean clothes.\nAs soon as possible, emergency responders will set up mass decontamination\ncapabilities. For radiological events, stations for radiation monitoring and blood tests will\nalso be set up to determine levels of exposure and what next steps to take to protect\nhealth.\nCBRNE\nCBRNE stands for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive.\nThese events have the capability to cause mass casualties and cause great public\nAugust 2019 Page 8-13\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nunrest. The anthrax letter attacks in 2001 are an example of how effective and\ndisrupting a CBRNE attack could be. The threat of CBRNE attacks has become less\nlikely as terrorists have moved on to new tactics, as discussed earlier in this unit.\nA CBRNE incident differs from a hazardous material incident in both scope (i.e.,\nCBRNE can be a mass casualty situation) and intent. CBRNE incidents are responded\nto under the assumption that they are intentional and malicious.\nCBRNE Indicators\nIt is important to be alert to changes in the environment as a clue to a possible terrorist\nattack.\nWhile bombs and explosions have obvious immediate effects, biological or chemical\nattacks may not be as immediately noticeable. Indicators that a biological or chemical\nattack has occurred or is underway could include:\n• Vapor clouds or mists that are unusual for the area or for the time of day.\n• Out of place and unattended packages, boxes, or vehicles. Items that are out of\nplace and unattended could signal a possible terrorist attack. This could include\nchemical or biological agents as well as explosives.\nIf you observe any of these indicators of a terrorist incident, you should:\n• Not touch it;\n• Move away from the object or area; and\n• Report it to authorities immediately.\nNuclear Attack\nA nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear\nreaction. All nuclear devices cause deadly effects when exploded, including blinding\nlight, intense heat, initial nuclear radiation, blast, fires started by the heat pulse,\nsecondary fires caused by the destruction, and widespread radioactive material that can\ncontaminate the air, water, and ground surfaces for miles around.\nA nuclear device can range from a weapon carried by an intercontinental ballistic\nmissile launched by a hostile nation or terrorist organization, to a small portable nuclear\ndevice transported by an individual.\nIn the very unlikely event you believe you are in a nuclear attack or exposed to\nradiation, there are three factors that significantly affect your safety after the incident:\ntime, distance, and shielding. A critical protective action in a radiological or nuclear\nevent is to get inside as quickly as possible, stay inside, and stay tuned to local radio or\ntelevision stations for further guidance.\n• Stay Inside (time): Limiting the amount of time in the area of an incident is\nimportant to limit exposure to radioactive fallout resulting from the explosion.\nRemain inside until you receive notification from authorities that it is safe to leave\nthe building. In most cases, be prepared to shelter inside for a few days.\nHowever, sheltering may be necessary for as long as a month.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-14\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\n• Go Deep Inside (distance/shielding): It is important to find adequate shelter\nquickly to avoid radioactive fallout resulting from the explosion. Get inside as\nsoon as possible and go to the farthest interior room or to a basement. Flat roofs\ncollect fallout particles, so the top floor is not a good choice, nor is a floor\nadjacent to a neighboring flat roof. The more distance between you and the\nfallout particles, the better.\nIf you are outside when the event occurs, do not look at the flash or fire ball. It can blind\nyou. Take cover behind anything that will offer protection, lie flat, and cover your head. If\nthe explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast\nwave to hit. Get inside as soon as you can.\nShelter-in-Place\nYou may receive direction from law enforcement to shelter-in-place. Depending on the\nnature of the threat (if it is chemical or biological), this may involve sealing yourself into\na room. Procedures for sheltering in place during a chemical or biological attack include:\n• Shut off the ventilation system and latch all doors and windows to reduce airflow\nfrom the outside.\n• Go to your shelter-in-place room (where your precut plastic, duct tape, radio, and\nother supplies should be stored).\n• Use precut plastic sheeting to cover openings where air can enter the room,\nincluding doors, windows, vents, electrical outlets, and telephone outlets. When\ncut, the sheeting should extend several inches beyond the dimensions of the\ndoor or window to allow room to duct tape the sheeting to the walls and floor.\n• Tape the plastic sheeting around all doors and windows using duct tape to\nensure a good seal.\n• Seal with duct tape other areas where air can come in, such as under doors and\nareas where pipes enter the home. Air can be blocked by placing towels or other\nsoft objects in areas where air could enter, then securing them with duct tape.\n• Chemicals used in an attack will be carried on the wind and will dissipate over\ntime. You will generally not need to stay in a sealed room for more than a few\nhours. Monitor Emergency Alert System broadcasts to know when it is safe to\nleave the safe room.\n• After contaminants have cleared, open windows and vents and turn on fans to\nprovide ventilation.\nTo be able to execute these procedures during an actual event, requires that you:\n• Store precut plastic sheeting in your identified shelter-in-place room.\n• Assemble and store food, water, and a battery-operated radio in the shelter-in-\nplace room.\n• Practice sealing the room.\n• Establish shelter-in-place procedures wherever you spend significant amounts of\ntime at home, at work, and/or at school.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-15\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nAs a rule of thumb, 10 square feet of floor space per person will provide sufficient air to\nprevent carbon dioxide buildup for up to 5 hours, assuming a normal breathing rate\nwhile resting.\nIf the threat is a violent individual(s), shelter-in-place may be referred to as a lockout\nand you may be asked to lock yourself into a safe space by doing the following:\n• Lock exterior doors.\n• Clear hallways, restrooms, and other rooms that cannot be secured.\n• Move all persons away from windows. Secure and cover windows, if able.\n• Make only essential communications and avoid any broadcasts about the\nmovement, location, or status of law enforcement in the area.\n• Once the threat has subsided, law enforcement announces, “all clear” and\noperations can return to normal.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-16\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nUNIT 8 SUMMARY\nThe key points from this unit are:\n• The definition of terrorism, as defined by the Department of Justice, is the\n“unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or\ncoerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in\nfurtherance of political or social objectives.” Terrorism may be perpetrated by\nforeign or domestic individuals or groups.\n• When terrorists attack, their goals are to:\n― Create mass casualties;\n― Disrupt critical resources, vital services, and the economy; and\n― Cause fear.\n• Terrorists have moved away from large, resource-intensive plots to complex,\ncoordinated attacks like those in Paris, France in 2016.\n• New tactics include active shooter events and detonating improvised explosive\ndevices, sometimes occurring simultaneously in coordinated attacks. In addition,\nan evolving terrorist tactic is cyberterrorism.\n• An Active Shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill\npeople in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use\nfirearms(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of targets. Active\nshooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate\ndeployment of law enforcement is required to stop the shooting and mitigate\nharm to survivors.\n• Run, Hide, Fight is the best way to respond if an active shooter is in your vicinity.\n• An IED attack is the use of a “homemade” bomb and/or destructive device to\ndestroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. Because they are improvised, IEDs can\ncome in many forms, ranging from a small pipe bomb to a sophisticated device\ncapable of causing massive damage and loss of life.\n• CERT volunteers, along with the public, play a critical role in identifying\nsuspicious activities occurring within the community. There are typically eight\nsigns of terrorism that signal potential terrorist activity. If identified and\ncommunicated correctly to local law enforcement, suspicious activities\nsurrounding the potential possibility of a terrorist attack can be stopped. The\neight signs of terrorism are:\n― Surveillance;\n― Elicitation;\n― Tests of security;\n― Funding;\n― Acquiring supplies;\n― Impersonation or suspicious people who don’t belong;\n― Rehearsal and dry runs; and\n― Deployment.\n• Terrorist attacks frequently occur without warning; however, being alert, reporting\nsuspicious activities, and taking general preparedness steps, such as having a\nplan to communicate with loved ones, will help you if one does occur. If you\nAugust 2019 Page 8-17\n\n\nCERT Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT Participant Manual\nbelieve a terrorist attack is imminent, call 9-1-1 and follow the instructions\nprovided.\n• CERT volunteers are NOT equipped or trained to response to terrorist incidents.\nCERT volunteers should in no way activate or respond to an incident in their\ncommunity.\n• While highly unlikely, it is possible that you may find yourself in a situation that\nyou believe is a terrorist attack. Like in any other situation, be mindful of your\nlimits and recognize that your safety is your top priority. Stay safe. Do not put\nyourself at risk but save lives if you can.\n• It is important to be alert to changes in the environment as a clue to possible\nCBRNE attack.\n― Vapor clouds or mists that are unusual for the area or for the time of day.\n― Out of place and unattended packages, boxes, or vehicles. Items that are\nout of place and unattended could signal a possible terrorist attack. This\ncould include chemical or biological agents as well as explosives.\n• If you observe any of these indicators:\n― Do not touch it;\n― Move away from the area; and\n― Report it to authorities immediately.\nHomework Assignment\nReview the materials to be presented in the next session.\nAugust 2019 Page 8-18\n\n\nCERT Unit 9: Course\nReview, Final Exam, and\nDisaster Simulation\nParticipant Manual\n\n\n\n\n\nCERT Unit 9: Course Review, Final Exam and Disaster\nSimulation\nThis unit includes:\n\u0000 A Review of Key Points from the Course\n\u0000 A Final Exam\n\u0000 A Final Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\nCERT Unit 9 Table of Contents\nSECTION 1: COURSE REVIEW ................................................................................................ 1\nCourse Overview .................................................................................................................... 1\nUnit 1: Disaster Preparedness ................................................................................................ 1\nUnit 2: CERT Organization ..................................................................................................... 1\nUnits 3 and 4: Disaster Medical Operations ............................................................................ 1\nUnit 5: Disaster Psychology .................................................................................................... 1\nUnit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls .................................................................................... 2\nUnit 7: Light Search and Rescue ............................................................................................ 2\nUnit 8: Terrorism ..................................................................................................................... 3\nSECTION 2: CERT BASIC TRAINING FINAL EXAM ................................................................ 4\nUnit 1: Disaster Preparedness ................................................................................................ 4\nUnit 2: CERT Organization ..................................................................................................... 5\nUnit 3: Disaster Medical Operations — Part 1 ......................................................................... 7\nUnit 4: Disaster Medical Operations — Part 2 ......................................................................... 9\nUnit 5: Disaster Psychology ...................................................................................................10\nUnit 6: Fire Safety and Utility Controls ...................................................................................11\nUnit 7: Light Search and Rescue Operations .........................................................................13\nUnit 8: Terrorism and CERT ..................................................................................................15\nSECTION 3: DISASTER SIMULATION ....................................................................................16\nSECTION 4: COURSE CONCLUSION .....................................................................................18\nAugust 2019 Unit 9 Table of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nCERT Unit 9: Course Review, Final Exam, and Disaster Simulation Participant Manual\nSECTION 1: COURSE REVIEW\nCourse Overview\nIf you do not remember a particular key point, refer back to that specific unit.",
